# Guest Flags

Description: Supervisors should be able to log "flags" associated with a guest that show up prominently when the guest's file is viewed:

- "Yellow flag": Something to pay attention to or keep in mind about the guest.
- "Red flag": Something serious enough to prevent a reenrollment of the guest.

Flags should have a "Description" field associated with them for further information.
