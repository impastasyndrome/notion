# Guest Risk Classification

Description: Build an interpretable, multiclass predictive model to attempt to assess the most likely outcome for arriving guests:

- Permanent exit
- Temporary exit
- Emergency shelter
- Transitional housing
- Unknown/other

This model needs to be interpretable because of the sensitive nature of the decision. All guests will receive a standard level of case management resources, but the guests classified as most at-risk may receive additional attention.

Include UX elements that caution the end user and place predictions/numbers in context.
