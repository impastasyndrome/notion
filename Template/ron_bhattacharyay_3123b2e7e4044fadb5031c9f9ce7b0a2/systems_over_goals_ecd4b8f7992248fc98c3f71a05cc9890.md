# systems over goals

I don't believe that achievements make for the best goals, and often lead to the optimization of inconsequential values. Likewise, I don't have enough foresight in my own life in order to dictate what more "real" goals should look like. Therefore, I've decided to focus on attribute building. I'd like to garner certain attributes over the course of each year, through certain milestones, and a lifetime to put myself in positions where I can affect change and work towards happiness. **I believe if I spend a lifetime doing the little things right every day, the places I'd like to go will come along and the journey will be one worth living.** This is an attempt to actualize those efforts and build systems to help me "level up" said attributes. I plan on following Google's [OKR bar for success](https://medium.com/@ryanpurdy/googles-ork-objectives-and-key-results-framework-notes-%EF%B8%8F-8d549abcdb93) (hit rate of 80% is ideal. Too low and you underachieved, too high and you're under-ambitious.)

I hope by writing this publicly I can find the same kind of accountability and feedback the internet promises without the attention and curation required of a "feed." I want to look back on this documentation and laugh. It'll mean I was far off from what should have been important to me or that the challenges I found daunting pale in hindsight. Either means I'm moving forward.
