# Tools & Platforms

<aside>
üìå **Navigating Lambda School:** 
Because Lambda School is a remote learning environment, we use a variety of tools and platforms to build community and support the Learner experience. Our most commonly used tools/platforms, along with requirements and recommendations for usage, are outlined below.

# Slack

- **What is Slack?**
  [Slack](https://slack.com/) is an online communication tool used widely in the tech industry. For Lambda School, it is the most important and frequent way we communicate with Learners. It's how Learners will receive Zoom links and participate during the Guided Project, and how they will often communicate with other Learners, staff, and instructors. If a Learner has never used Slack before, they should get to know it well. Nearly every company in Silicon Valley uses it, and it‚Äôs rapidly becoming a point of competence across software engineering teams.
- **How does a Learner join Lambda's Slack workspace?**
  After completing the Learner confirmation form, Learners will receive an invitation to the Slack workspace. Once they accept their Slack invite, they will be automatically assigned to a few main channels specific to their core track and cohort.
  _Example:_ If a Learner is joining the WEB24 class (Full Stack Web, Class 24), they will be added to _#web24_ and _#web24_help_.
- **Set up a profile**
  - A picture of the Learner's face (must be a professionally appropriate photo - no drawings, cartoons, or other imagery)
  - The Learner's first and last name
  - Their course and section
  - Optional: Gender pronouns
  - See Code of Conduct for more information
- **Slack Channels**
  We have a lot of Slack channels, and it can be overwhelming to know which ones to join and participate in. Click here for a cheatsheet of channels we feel are beneficial to get you started!

**Slack Expectations & Etiquette:**

- **_Remember: Professionalism always. See the [Code of Conduct](Code%20of%20Conduct%20b11fec77b76841189d8a9db5b89d948a.md) for additional information._**
- Do
  - Be considerate of others when contributing to a channel
  - Use the section's main channel for content related purposes
  - Use the section's Help channel to ask questions & get support
  - Use threads üßµ
- Don't
  - Use profanity
  - Use a profile picture that's not a professional photo of their face (does not need to be professionally taken, but professional in nature)
  - Use @channel (this can be disruptive to channel members) - this feature is reserved for staff and instructors
  - Use channels for posts that are not aligned with the channel's intended purpose
  - Establish or contribute to channels that disrupt the learning environment
  - Use channels for solicitations
  - Share inappropriate content
  - Create inappropriate emojis

**Slack FAQ:**

- What channels should a Learner join?
  - Students will be added to all their class affiliated channels (Ex. #ds8, #ds8_help, #ds8_ah). Outside of their required class channels, they are encouraged to connect with the Lambda community and join other public channels that may be of interest to them (hobby/interest area, geographic location, etc.). To browse all public channels, click _Channels_ in the Slack sidebar.
  - Some popular channels include: #hired, #career_help, #women, #diversityintech, #lambda_rainbow, #pets
- What do @channel and @here do?
  - Typing a message in Slack that includes ‚Äú@here‚Äù or ‚Äú@channel‚Äù notifies everyone in that channel. This sends an alert to their desktop or, in many cases, their personal cellphones. **As such, only staff and instructors may use ‚Äú@here‚Äù and ‚Äù@channel‚Äù.** Thanks for helping us keep Slack usable!

# Zoom

- **What is Zoom?**
  [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is an online remote meeting service. While at Lambda School Learners will use Zoom to receive lectures, pair program, work on their group projects, and receive 1:1 support from the Instruction team, and more!
