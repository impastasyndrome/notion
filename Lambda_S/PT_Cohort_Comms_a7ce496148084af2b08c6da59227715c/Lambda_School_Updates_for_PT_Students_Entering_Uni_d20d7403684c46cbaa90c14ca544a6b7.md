# Lambda School Updates for PT Students Entering Unit 2 - Oct. 2020

_Starting on Monday (10/26), many of the changes to the school that rolled out to full-time students and other part-time cohorts at the end of September will affect you as you move to your next unit. We want to let you know how these changes will impact you, since they will affect each cohort a bit differently depending on where the cohort is in the Lambda School journey._

👉 **For Lambda students starting Unit 2 on 10/26, here’s what’s new for you:**

## _Lambda Leadership_

Employers are looking for new hires who not only have technical knowledge, but also the ability to communicate clearly and work effectively together on professional teams. [Lambda Leadership](https://lambdaschool.com/lambda-leadership) helps you build your leadership skills, strengthen your technical skills, and expand your network.

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg)

### What's Changing?

There are two main components to the Lambda Leadership Program:

- **Peer Mentorship** is designed to give students the opportunity to both be matched with a peer mentor and be peer mentors themselves. Research shows that this type of social learning can help students solidify their knowledge and build critical team skills - and that these specific skills are in high demand among hiring managers in the industry.
- **Track Teams** are made up of students from each core curriculum cohort in a track, and will replace the current cohort stand-up groups. Within Track Teams, students will rotate into various leadership roles. In most cases, the Track Team will become your Build Sprint team.

<aside>
💡 We’ve been piloting both of these programs for several months, and based on student feedback before and after launch, we’ve made some updates, including schedule adjustments, adding more mentor skills training and refining content for Track Teams.

📚 While we’re rolling out the Lambda Leadership Program this fall, we’re also in the process of **doubling our number of instructors across Web and Data Science** to provide extra technical support to students. We have already added a number of these, and hope to have the rest in place by early next year. These additional instructors will enable Lambda School to offer additional support hours and thematic Q&A sessions. Instructors will also be available to provide more 1:1 guidance to students who need focused support.

</aside>

### **How this affects you and other students starting Unit 2 on 10/26:**

- You’ll be assigned a peer mentor who is further along in your track. With your peer mentor, you’ll talk through projects, practice technical interview skills, and get 1:1 support from someone further along in their Lambda journey.
- You’ll also be added to a Track Team. With your Track Team, you’ll receive leadership training, build team skills, and gain valuable practice on behavioral and technical interview skills during stand-up time in Sprints 1-3.
- You'll receive a Slack message about your peer mentor and Track Team on Wednesday before class starts.
- There will be an orientation for Lambda Leadership on Monday, 10/26 - stay tuned for more news in your cohort channel!
- Additional instructors have been hired for PT cohorts for Unit 2 for Web, but not yet for Data Science. Data Science students will have additional TL & TA support for project Q&As and support hours.

<aside>
🌟 We've made fifth days more flexible. You're free to select the times that work best for you to complete your Lambda studies. You should still plan on the same number of hours you currently spend on Lambda over the weekend, but you can choose times that work best for you. However, please note that support options will only be available in the existing, standard fifth day hours (specific times will be posted in your cohort channel).

## _Shortened School Schedule_

We know that it can be difficult to take this much time to focus on Lambda School. Many of you are dealing with real challenges around how to financially support yourselves and your families, or how to manage other commitments such as child care. In response to your concerns, we’ve worked hand-in-hand with hiring managers to develop a new curriculum that can prepare you for a tech job in a shorter amount of time.

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg)

### **What’s changing?**

- **CS:** We’ve updated and streamlined CS content into one unit instead of two based on what we’re seeing in industry. The new CS curriculum will focus on the CS skills you’ll need to succeed in technical interviews and early on in your new jobs. For more on what exactly is changing in the CS curriculum, [please see this FAQ](https://www.notion.so/FAQ-regarding-New-CS-Curriculum-9881388a95c24d388323e0b01a269aa4).
- **Labs:** We’ve updated and streamlined Labs content into one unit instead of two. Hiring managers overwhelmingly told us they are looking for practical teamwork experience over portfolio pieces - and we believe you can attain this experience in one unit.
- The updated CS and Labs curriculum allows Lambda School to be 24 Sprints long instead of 32 Sprints.

### **How this affects you and other students starting Unit 2 next week:**

- Students starting Unit 2, like you, will complete Lambda School’s program in **24 sprints.**
- **As a current student, you have the option to opt out of this change and complete all 32 sprints.** We'll be organizing **optional, information sessions** when you are in Computer Science to **help you understand how these two options compare** so you can make the best decision for you. The final deadline to opt out will be the end of the last day of your first week of Labs, but before that date, we’ll check in with you about what you’d like to do. **There’s** **no need to let us know sooner** that you’d like to opt out; we’ll be in touch with you when the deadline is approaching.
- Please note PT students who flex into cohorts that start 10/26 or prior will still have the ability to opt-out of the shortened school schedule. However, we will no longer be able to offer opting-out of the shortened school schedule for cohorts starting after 10/26 for PT.

## _Career Services_

To support students in their job search, we’ve redesigned our Career Services to give students more practice with career-building skills throughout the program and after graduation.

### **What’s changing?**

- **Networking**: During your Career Lessons and Track Team meetings, we’ve integrated additional networking lessons and resources. Topics will include how to build your resume, how to refine your social media profiles, how to conduct cold outreach to industry professionals, and more.
- **Interview Practice**: [Practice for technical and behavioral interviews](https://my.lambdaschool.com/interviewing) will now occur more frequently throughout the program. This will take many forms, from explaining technical concepts with your peer mentor to in-depth coding assessments in CS. Students who would like additional support with interview skills will have access to [Career Coaches](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help) throughout their journey.
- **Industry Mentors:** We’re expanding our popular [**Industry Mentorship Program**](https://www.notion.so/Industry-Mentor-Program-28782181f2e04060b266d447b10cdee0) so that all students can participate while in Labs. Working with an Industry Mentor will help you build your network and give you more real-world career skills**.**
- **Job Search**: After you graduate, you’ll receive [dedicated support to help you land a job](https://my.lambdaschool.com/job-search). You will work 1:1 with a Job Search Trainer, use our [Job Board](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/) to track your progress, and receive access to Career Coaches to prepare for your scheduled interviews. We’ll work hard to match you with job opportunities from our hiring partners, too.

### **How this affects you and other students starting Unit 2 on 10/26:**

- Students starting in Unit 2, like you, will quickly notice the greater emphasis on networking and interview practice integrated into the program.
- You’ll be matched with an industry mentor while you're in Labs.
- The Job Search resources will be available to you once you graduate.

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg)

In addition to the changes described above, you’ll notice a few other changes rolling out this month to support your learning experience:

- We’ll be **migrating students from Training Kit to a platform called Canvas** to improve the curriculum experience. Starting on 10/26, you'll use Canvas to find your course content, assignments, guided project materials, and more. You’ll also use Canvas to submit assignments, which will include check-for-understanding questions, self-reflections, and the ability to provide feedback on your experience. We'll host a live, optional Canvas Q&A at 5:30 PM on Wednesday, 10/28 and before 10/26 will also provide step-by-step tutorials.
- We’ve already **rolled out an [improved Flex policy](../Flex%20327badd4502a4fc099db0effa1e69474.md) last month.** Going forward, we’ll continue to iterate on this policy based on student and staff feedback. We’ll be in touch to make you aware of any future changes to flex policies or procedures.
- We’re **revamping our /frontdesk support** to ensure we can respond to your questions and requests more promptly. Please remember that responses to /frontdesk inquires will still reach you **via your Lambda school email.**
- Again, we’re in the process of **doubling our number of instructors across Web and Data Science** to provide additional technical support to students. These additional instructors will enable us to offer more support hours, thematic Q&A sessions, and 1:1 guidance to students who need focused support. Additional instructors have been hired for PT cohorts for Unit 2 for Web, but not yet for Data Science. Data Science students will have additional TL & TA support for project Q&As and support hours.

❓**What if you Flex and repeat Unit 1?** Don’t worry! We'll reach out to be sure you understand exactly what's changing for Unit 1 students starting on 10/26.
