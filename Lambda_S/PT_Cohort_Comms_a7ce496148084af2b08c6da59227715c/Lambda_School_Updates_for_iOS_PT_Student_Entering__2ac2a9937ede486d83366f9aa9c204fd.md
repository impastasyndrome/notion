# Lambda School Updates for iOS PT Student Entering Unit 4 - Oct. 2020

_Starting on Monday (10/26), many of the changes to the school that rolled out to full-time students and other part-time cohorts at the end of September will affect you as you move to your next unit. We want to let you know how these changes will impact you, since they will affect each cohort a bit differently depending on where the cohort is in the Lambda School journey._

üëâ **For Lambda iOS PT students starting Unit 4 on 10/26, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new for you:**

## _Lambda Leadership_

The core programs of Lambda Leadership - Track Teams and Peer Mentorship - are dependent upon collaboration across multiple units in the same track. Since this is the final cohort of the iOS program, these programs can't work as designed for iOS students, and you will not be participating in Track Teams or Peer Mentorship.

### **How this affects you and other students starting Unit 4 on 10/26:**

- You will continue in your current group with your current structure and schedule.

<aside>
üåü We've made fifth days more flexible. You're free to select the times that work best for you to complete your Lambda studies. You should still plan on the same number of hours you currently spend on Lambda over the weekend, but you can choose times that work best for you. However, please note that support options will only be available in the existing, standard fifth day hours (specific times will be posted in your cohort channel).

## _Shortened School Schedule_

We know that it can be difficult to take this much time to focus on Lambda School. Many of you are dealing with real challenges around how to financially support yourselves and your families, or how to manage other commitments such as child care. In response to your concerns, we‚Äôve worked hand-in-hand with hiring managers to develop a new curriculum that can prepare you for a tech job in a shorter amount of time.

### **What‚Äôs changing?**

- **CS:** We‚Äôve updated and streamlined CS content into one unit instead of two based on what we‚Äôre seeing in industry. The new CS curriculum will focus on the CS skills you‚Äôll need to succeed in technical interviews and early on in your new jobs. For more on what exactly is changing in the CS curriculum, [please see this FAQ](https://www.notion.so/FAQ-regarding-New-CS-Curriculum-9881388a95c24d388323e0b01a269aa4).
- **Labs:** We‚Äôve updated and streamlined Labs content into one unit instead of two. Hiring managers overwhelmingly told us they are looking for practical teamwork experience over portfolio pieces - and we believe you can attain this experience in one unit.
- The updated CS and Labs curriculum allows Lambda School to be 24 Sprints long instead of 32 Sprints.

### **How this affects you and others starting Unit 4 on 10/26:**

- Students starting Unit 4, like you, will complete Lambda School‚Äôs program in **24 sprints.**
- **As a current student, you have the option to opt out of this change and complete all 32 sprints.** We'll be organizing **optional, information sessions** when you are in Computer Science to **help you understand how these two options compare** so you can make the best decision for you. The final deadline to opt out will be the end of the last day of your first week of Labs, but before that date, we‚Äôll check in with you about what you‚Äôd like to do. **There‚Äôs** **no need to let us know sooner** that you‚Äôd like to opt out; we‚Äôll be in touch with you when the deadline is approaching.
- Please note PT students who flex into cohorts that start 10/26 or prior will still have the ability to opt-out of the shortened school schedule. However, we will no longer be able to offer opting-out of the shortened school schedule for cohorts starting after 10/26 for PT.

## _Career Services_

To support students in their job search, we‚Äôve redesigned our Career Services to give students more practice with career-building skills throughout the program and after graduation.

### **What‚Äôs changing?**

- **Networking**: During your Career Lessons meetings, we‚Äôve integrated additional networking lessons and resources. Topics will include how to build your resume, how to refine your social media profiles, how to conduct cold outreach to industry professionals, and more.
- **Interview Practice**: [Practice for technical and behavioral interviews](https://my.lambdaschool.com/interviewing) will now occur more frequently throughout the program. This will take many forms, from explaining technical concepts with your cohort peers to in-depth coding assessments in CS. During your Lambda experience, you‚Äôll also take interviews with professional technical interviewers to prepare for the job search. Students who would like additional support with interview skills will have access to [Career Coaches](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help) throughout their journey.
- **Industry Mentors:** We‚Äôre expanding our popular [**Industry Mentorship Program**](https://www.notion.so/Industry-Mentor-Program-28782181f2e04060b266d447b10cdee0) so that students can participate while in Labs. Working with an Industry Mentor will help you build your network and give you more real-world career skills.
- **Job Search**: After you graduate, you‚Äôll receive [dedicated support to help you land a job](https://my.lambdaschool.com/job-search). You will work 1:1 with [a Job Search Trainer](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help), use our [Job Board](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/) to track your progress, and receive access to Career Coaches to prepare for your scheduled interviews. We‚Äôll work hard to match you with job opportunities from our hiring partners, too.

### **How this affects you and others starting Unit 4 on 10/26:**

- Students starting in Unit 4, like you, will quickly notice the greater emphasis on networking and interview practice integrated into the program.
- You‚Äôll be matched with an industry mentor while in Labs.
- The Job Search resources will be available to you once you graduate.

In addition to the changes described above, you‚Äôll notice a few other changes rolling out this month to support your learning experience:

- **You will not be migrating to Canvas for Unit 4**. You will continue using Training Kit and the Forms app as you do now. You will be migrated to Canvas when you enter CS.
- We‚Äôve already **rolled out an [improved Flex policy](../Flex%20327badd4502a4fc099db0effa1e69474.md) last month**. Going forward, we‚Äôll continue to iterate on this policy based on student and staff feedback. We‚Äôll be in touch to make you aware of any future changes to flex policies or procedures.
- We‚Äôre **revamping our /frontdesk support** to ensure we can respond to your questions and requests more promptly. Please remember that responses to /frontdesk inquires will still reach you **via your Lambda school email.**

‚ùì**What if you Flex and repeat Unit 3?** Don‚Äôt worry! We'll reach out to be sure you understand exactly what's changing for Unit 3 students starting on 10/26.
