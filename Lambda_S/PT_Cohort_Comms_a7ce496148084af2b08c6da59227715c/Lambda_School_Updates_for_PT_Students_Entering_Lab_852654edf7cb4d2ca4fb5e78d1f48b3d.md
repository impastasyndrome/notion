# Lambda School Updates for PT Students Entering Labs - Oct. 2020

_Starting on Monday (10/26), many of the changes to the school that rolled out to full-time students and other part-time cohorts at the end of September will affect you as you move to your next unit. We want to let you know how these changes will impact you, since they will affect each cohort a bit differently depending on where the cohort is in the Lambda School journey._

👉 **For Lambda students starting Labs on 10/26, here’s what’s new for you:**

## _Lambda Leadership_

Employers are looking for new hires who not only have technical knowledge, but also the ability to communicate clearly and work effectively together on professional teams. [Lambda Leadership](https://lambdaschool.com/lambda-leadership) helps you build your leadership skills, strengthen your technical skills, and expand your network.

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg)

### **What’s changing?**

There are two main components to the Lambda Leadership Program that we’re introducing on 10/26:

- **Peer Mentorship** is designed to give students the opportunity to both be matched with a peer mentor and be peer mentors themselves. Research shows that this type of social learning can help students solidify their knowledge and build critical team skills - and that these specific skills are in high demand among hiring managers in the industry.
- **Track Teams** are made up of students from each cohort in a track, and will replace the current cohort stand-up groups. On Track Teams, students will rotate into various leadership roles. In most cases, the Track Team will become your Build Sprint team.

<aside>
💡 We’ve been piloting both of these programs for several months, and based on student feedback before and after launch, we’ve made some updates, including schedule adjustments, adding more mentor skills training and refining content for Track Teams

<aside>
📚 While we’re rolling out the Lambda Leadership Program this fall, we’re also in the process of **doubling our number of instructors across Web and Data Science** to provide extra technical support to students. These additional instructors will enable Lambda School to offer additional support hours and thematic Q&A sessions. As we are still in the process of hiring additional instructors, Labs students will receive additional support from TPLs and APLs.

</aside>

### **How this affects you and others starting Labs on 10/26:**

- You’ll be matched with a mentee and serve as a peer mentor to a student earlier in their Lambda journey. With your mentee, you’ll talk through projects, answer questions, and practice technical interview skills. Before you become a peer mentor, we’ll provide training on best practices to set you up for success. Research shows that this type of social learning can help students solidify their knowledge and build critical team skills, which will help you in your job search.
- **\*Please note:** iOS students will not be matched with a peer mentee.\*
- Please note PT students who flex into cohorts that start 10/26 or prior will still have the ability to opt-out of the shortened school schedule. However, we will no longer be able to offer opting-out of the shortened school schedule for cohorts starting after 10/26 for PT.
- To get the most out of the Labs experience, you’ll continue to work with your Labs project team instead of being assigned to a Track Team.
- You'll receive additional support from APLs (Associate Project Leads) and TPLs (Technical Project Leads) in Labs.

<aside>
🌟 We've made fifth days more flexible. You're free to select the times that work best for you to complete your Lambda studies. You should still plan on the same number of hours you currently spend on Lambda over the weekend, but you can choose times that work best for you. However, please note that support options will only be available in the existing, standard fifth day hours (specific times will be posted in your cohort channel).

## _Shortened School Schedule_

We’ve worked hand-in-hand with hiring managers to develop a new curriculum that can prepare students for a tech job in a shorter amount of time.

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg)

### **What’s changing?**

- **CS:** We’ve updated and streamlined CS into one unit instead of two units, to focus on certain CS skills students will need to succeed in technical interviews and early in their jobs.
- **Labs:** We’ve updated and streamlined Labs content into one unit instead of two. Hiring managers overwhelmingly told us they are looking for practical teamwork experience over portfolio pieces - and we believe you can attain this experience in one unit.

### **How this affects you and others starting Labs on 10/26:**

- Students starting Labs, like you, will complete Lambda School’s program in **28 sprints.** This means, by default, this will be your last unit prior to graduation.
- **As a current student, you have the option to opt out of this change and complete all 32 sprints.** We'll be organizing **optional, information sessions** when you are in Computer Science to **help you understand how these two options compare** so you can make the best decision for you. The final deadline to opt out will be the end of the last day of your first week of Labs, but before that date, we’ll check in with you about what you’d like to do. **There’s** **no need to let us know sooner** that you’d like to opt out; we’ll be in touch with you when the deadline is approaching.
- Please note PT students who flex into cohorts that start 10/26 or prior will still have the ability to opt-out of the shortened school schedule. However, we will no longer be able to offer opting-out of the shortened school schedule for cohorts starting after 10/26 for PT.

## _Career Services_

To support students in their job search, we’ve redesigned our Career Services to give students more practice with career-building skills throughout the program and after graduation.

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/zoom.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/zoom.jpg)

### **What’s changing?**

- **Interview Practice**: [Practice for technical and behavioral interviews](https://my.lambdaschool.com/interviewing) will now occur more frequently throughout the program. In Labs, you'll practice technical interviewing weekly with your Technical Project Lead and receive valuable feedback as you prepare for the Job Search. You’ll also interview with a professional technical interviewer during Labs. Students who would like additional support with behavioral interview skills will have access to [Career Coaches](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help) throughout their journey.
- **Industry Mentors:** We’re expanding our popular [Industry Mentorship Program](https://www.notion.so/Industry-Mentor-Program-28782181f2e04060b266d447b10cdee0) \***\*so that \*\***all students can participate while in Labs. Working with an Industry Mentor will help you build your network and give you more real-world career skills.
- **Preparation for Job Search:** During Labs, you will polish your job application materials (resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub) so that you’re ready to hit the ground running in your job search.
- **Job Search**: After you graduate, you’ll receive [dedicated support to help you land a job](https://my.lambdaschool.com/job-search). You will work 1:1 with [a Job Search Trainer](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help), use our [Job Board](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/) to track your progress, and receive access to Career Coaches to prepare for your scheduled interviews. We’ll work hard to match you with job opportunities from our hiring partners, too.

### **How this affects you and others starting Labs on 10/26:**

- Students in Labs, like you, will notice an emphasis on technical interview preparation. You'll practice technical interviewing weekly with your Technical Project Lead and receive valuable feedback as you prepare for the Job Search.
- During Labs, you will also interview with a professional technical interviewer.
- You won't be matched with an Industry Mentor immediately (since the program is 8 weeks long), but will be matched closer to graduation.
- All students in Labs will polish their application materials to prepare for the Job Search.
- The Job Search resources will be available to you once you graduate.

In addition to the changes described above, you’ll notice a few other changes rolling out this month to support your learning experience:

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg)

- We’ll be **migrating students from Training Kit to a platform called Canvas** to improve the curriculum experience. Starting on 10/26, you'll use Canvas to find your course content, assignments, guided project materials, and more. You’ll also use Canvas to submit assignments, which will include check-for-understanding questions, self-reflections, and the ability to provide feedback on your experience. We'll host a live, optional Canvas Q&A at 5:30 PM on Wednesday, 10/28 and before 10/26 will also provide step-by-step tutorials.
- We’ve already **rolled out an [improved Flex policy](../Flex%20327badd4502a4fc099db0effa1e69474.md) last month.** Going forward, we’ll continue to iterate on this policy based on student and staff feedback. We’ll be in touch to make you aware of any future changes to flex policies or procedures.
- We’re **revamping our /frontdesk support** to ensure we can respond to your questions and requests more promptly. Please remember that responses to /frontdesk inquires will still reach you **via your Lambda school email.**
- Again, we’re **doubling our number of instructors across Web and Data Science** to provide additional technical support to students. These additional instructors will enable us to offer more support hours, thematic Q&A sessions, and 1:1 guidance to students who need focused support. s we are still in the process of hiring additional instructors across all units, TPLs and APLs will provide additional support to Labs students.

❓**What if you Flex and repeat CS Unit 2?** Don’t worry! We'll reach out to be sure you understand exactly what's changing for CS Unit 2 students starting on 10/26.
