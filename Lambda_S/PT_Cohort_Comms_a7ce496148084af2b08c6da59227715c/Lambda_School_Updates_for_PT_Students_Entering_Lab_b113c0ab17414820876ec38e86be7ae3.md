# Lambda School Updates for PT Students Entering Labs 2 - Oct. 2020

_Starting on Monday (10/26), many of the changes to the school that rolled out to full-time students and other part-time cohorts at the end of September will affect you as you move to your next unit. We want to let you know how these changes will impact you, since they will affect each cohort a bit differently depending on where the cohort is in the Lambda School journey._

üëâ **For Lambda students starting Labs Unit 2 on 10/26, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new for you:**

## _Lambda Leadership_

Employers are looking for new hires who not only have technical knowledge, but also the ability to communicate clearly and work effectively together on professional teams. We‚Äôre introducing Lambda Leadership Program to help students build their leadership skills, strengthen their technical skills, and expand their networks. The new program includes two main components: Peer Mentorship and Track Teams. You can read more about [Lambda Leadership here](https://lambdaschool.com/lambda-leadership).

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg)

### **How this affects you and others starting Labs Unit 2 next week:**

- Given where you are in the program, you will not participate in Lambda Leadership.
- You‚Äôll continue to work with your Labs project team, rather than joining a Track Team.
- You'll receive additional support from APLs (Associate Project Leads) and TPLs (Technical Project Leads) in Labs.

<aside>
üìö While we‚Äôre rolling out the Lambda Leadership Program this fall, we‚Äôre also in the process of **doubling our number of instructors across Web and Data Science** to provide extra technical support to students. We have already added a number of these, and hope to have the rest in place by early next year. These additional instructors will enable Lambda School to offer additional support hours and thematic Q&A sessions. Again, students in Labs will receive additional support from APLs and TPLs.

<aside>
üåü We've made fifth days more flexible. You're free to select the times that work best for you to complete your Lambda studies. You should still plan on the same number of hours you currently spend on Lambda over the weekend, but you can choose times that work best for you. However, please note that support options will only be available in the existing, standard fifth day hours (specific times will be posted in your cohort channel).

## _Shortened School Schedule_

We‚Äôve worked hand-in-hand with hiring managers to develop a new curriculum that can prepare students for a tech job in a shorter amount of time. We‚Äôve updated and streamlined CS into one unit instead of two units, to focus on certain CS skills that students will need to succeed in technical interviews and early in their jobs. And we‚Äôve updated Labs content into one unit instead of two, focusing on teamwork experience.

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg)

### **How this affects you and others starting Labs Unit 2 on 10/26:**

- Students starting Labs Unit 2, like you, will complete Lambda School‚Äôs program in the original 32 \*\*\*\*sprints, focusing on the teamwork skills that will help you in your job search.
- Please note PT students who flex into cohorts that start 10/26 or prior will still have the ability to opt-out of the shortened school schedule. However, we will no longer be able to offer opting-out of the shortened school schedule for cohorts starting after 10/26 for PT.

## _Career Services_

To support students in their job search, we‚Äôve redesigned our Career Services to give students more practice with career-building skills throughout the program and after graduation.

### **What‚Äôs changing?**

- **Interview Practice**: [Practice for technical and behavioral interviews](https://my.lambdaschool.com/interviewing) will now occur more frequently throughout the program. In Labs, you'll practice technical interviewing weekly with your Technical Project Lead and receive valuable feedback as you prepare for the Job Search. You‚Äôll also interview with a professional technical interviewer during Labs. Students who would like additional support with behavioral interview skills will have access to [Career Coaches](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help) throughout their journey.
- **Industry Mentors:** We‚Äôre expanding our popular [**Industry Mentorship Program**](https://www.notion.so/Industry-Mentor-Program-28782181f2e04060b266d447b10cdee0) so that students can participate while in Labs. Working with an Industry Mentor will help you build your network and give you more real-world career skills.
- **Preparation for Job Search:** During Labs, you will polish your job application materials (resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub) so that you‚Äôre ready to hit the ground running in your job search.
- **Job Search**: After you graduate, you‚Äôll receive [dedicated support to help you land a job](https://my.lambdaschool.com/job-search). You will work 1:1 with [a Job Search Trainer](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help), use our [Job Board](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/) to track your progress, and receive access to Career Coaches to prepare for your scheduled interviews. We‚Äôll work hard to match you with job opportunities from our hiring partners, too.

### **How this affects you and others starting Labs Unit 2 on 10/26:**

- Students in Labs, like you, will notice an emphasis on technical interview preparation. You'll practice technical interviewing weekly with your Technical Project Lead (TPL) and receive valuable feedback as you prepare for the Job Search.
- During Labs, you will also interview with a professional technical interviewer.
- You‚Äôll be matched with an industry mentor later on in Labs.
- All students in Labs will polish their application materials to prepare for the Job Search.
- The Job Search resources will be available to you once you graduate.

In addition to the changes described above, you‚Äôll notice a few other changes rolling out this month to support your learning experience:

![../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg](../Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg)

- We‚Äôll be **migrating students from Training Kit to a platform called Canvas** to improve the curriculum experience. Starting on 10/26, you'll use Canvas to find your course content, assignments, guided project materials, and more. You‚Äôll also use Canvas to submit assignments, which will include check-for-understanding questions, self-reflections, and the ability to provide feedback on your experience. We'll host a live, optional Canvas Q&A at 5:30 PM on Wednesday, 10/28 and before 10/26 will also provide step-by-step tutorials.
- We‚Äôve already **rolled out an [improved Flex policy](../Flex%20327badd4502a4fc099db0effa1e69474.md) last month**. Going forward, we‚Äôll continue to iterate on this policy based on student and staff feedback. We‚Äôll be in touch to make you aware of any future changes to flex policies or procedures.
- We‚Äôre **revamping our /frontdesk support** to ensure we can respond to your questions and requests more promptly. Please remember that responses to /frontdesk inquires will still reach you **via your Lambda school email.**
- You'll receive additional support from APLs (Associate Project Leads) and TPLs (Technical Project Leads) in Labs.

‚ùì**What if you Flex and repeat Labs Unit 1?** Don‚Äôt worry! We'll reach out to be sure you understand exactly what's changing for Labs Unit 1 students starting on 10/26.
