# iOS Development

iOS Development encompasses the study of two different programming languages, many different software frameworks, mobile UI and UX design, and the concepts of human/computer interaction.

These skills will enable Students to build rich mobile applications that enlighten, inform, instruct, and entertain a potential audience of users measured in the hundreds of millions.

### During this program, students will learn:

- Swift
- Objective-C
- UI Design
- Networking (as part of asynchronous programming)
- Core Data (database design)
- Unit and UI Testing
- Architectural Design Patterns
- Custom Controls & Programmatic UI
- Working with Media

### The overall schedule is:

- **Unit 1**: iOS Fundamentals - Learn core Swift language skills and basic app architecture, concepts that form the basis of all future learning in the track.
- **Unit 2**: Networking and Persistence - With the fundamentals covered, this unit dives into some of the most important and useful areas of the iOS SDK (software development kit). Students will learn about asynchronous networking, drawing custom controls, and persisting data to a database with Core Data.
- **Unit 3**: Architecture and Testing - A deeper dive into how best to construct an app project with a discussion of Swift generics as well as more exploration of concurrent programming. Students will see how concurrency works at a high level, and also the best practices for handling concurrency in iOS through the use of OperationQueues and Grand Central Dispatch.
- **Unit 4**: Objective-C and Beyond - Objective-C, the other language used to build apps, is explored extensively in this unit. The lessons learned here will help students understand and utilize the extensive library of legacy code used in millions of iOS apps in the field. Students also get an overview of media interaction with things like: audio, video, image manipulation, and mapping.
- **Units 5-6**: Labs - Work on a cross-functional app project, building an iOS app that encompasses techniques learned from the first 4 units.
- **Units 7-8**: Computer Science - Learn about data structures and computing in more depth, utilizing Python to firm up concepts first encountered in the core iOS track. Students will learn specific techniques and best practices to help them successfully tackle technical interviews.
- **Units 9-10**: Lambda Next - At this point students will be focused on searching for a job, and can also join additional projects, review past material, or otherwise prepare for their career in iOS development!

### **Announcement: June 9, 2020**

Hi all,

We’re sad to share that we’ve decided to end new enrollment to the iOS program. While this may come as a surprise, know that our commitment and support to you, our current students, is unwavering. We’re here for you until you have completed the program and are hired. You are our focus.

iOS was one of our early new programs, and while students who’ve completed the program have had great outcomes, we’ve not been able to sustain enrollment in the program. We faced a decision of doubling down to ensure enrollment in the iOS program, or directing that energy toward our Web and DS programs. We made a tough business decision and chose the latter.

You’re probably wondering what this means for you. The answer is, it depends on where you are in the program. For those of you farther along, this will not impact you significantly. If you are in iOS17 or iOSPT7, please read your respective link below to see how this will affect you:
