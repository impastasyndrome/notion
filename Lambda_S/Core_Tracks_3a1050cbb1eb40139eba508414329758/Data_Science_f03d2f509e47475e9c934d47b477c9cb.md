What is Data Science? Is it math? Statistics? Programming?

All of the above, and more! With Data Science, Students will get the skills they need to understand and explain real-world situations with data. This means both learning the theoretical underpinnings of math and computation we rely on, and appreciating the complexity of reality and how data is generally, at best, an approximation.

During this program, you will learn topics including:

- Python
- SQL
- Data Storytelling
- Statistics & Modeling
- Machine Learning
- Linear Algebra
- Databases
- Big Data
- Visualization

The overall schedule is:

- **Unit 1: Statistics Fundamentals** - Data Wrangling and Storytelling, Statistical Tests and Experiments, Linear Algebra
- **Unit 2: Predictive Modeling** - Linear Models, Model Comparison, Applied Modeling
- **Unit 3: Data Engineering** - Software Engineering, SQL and Databases, Productization and Cloud
- **Unit 4: Machine Learning** - Natural Language Processing, Neural Network Foundations, Cutting-edge models and architectures
- **Units 5: Computer Science -** Intro to Python and OOP, Algorithms, Data Structures, Graphs, Hash Tables, and Coding Interview Tips
- **Unit 6: Labs** - Participate in our in-house apprenticeship by building a real-world project in a small team
- **Job Search Support** - Continuing education and ongoing Job Search support with your Job Search Trainer and additional support from Career Services
