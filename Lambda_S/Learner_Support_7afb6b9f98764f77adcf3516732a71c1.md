# Learner Support

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ **Pro Tip:** Lambda School's coursework is intensive, but while it is designed to challenge Learners, there are numerous resources available to provide them with the support they need to succeed. While Learners are here, they are encouraged to take advantage of each opportunity to further their learning, and should not be afraid to ask for help when they need it!

# Help @ Lambda School

Learners have access to a variety of resources to help them in their journey. If a Learner ever needs help or support:

**Help Channels -** each cohort has a help channel, and there are several topic-based channels as well.

# For Technical Support:

**Instructors** will be available to support Learners at a number of different points throughout the day. Learners will be able to ask questions and get live responses during Guided Projects. Instructors will also offer Q&A sessions during Module Project Time (check your cohortâ€™s calendar for specific days & times) and they will also monitor #help-channels in Slack throughout class hours to provide answers to questions asynchronously.

In addition, take advantage of **pair programming** opportunities and **study groups** for questions about coursework, technical concepts and code reviews. Reach out to your instructor for additional support with coding and team work skills.

# For Career Support:

**Career Coaches** are available to Learners starting from day one at Lambda to help with any career-related questions. They also host workshops and hold office hours for 1:1 support. Submit a /frontdesk ticket and get a direct response from a coach within 24 hours or [drop into office hours.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=lambdaschool.com_h86abn6o840diu4p1aeual9m90@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)

After Learners graduate, they will work with our Career Coaches**,** who will help Learners create a personalized job search strategy and provide support through their job search process.
