# Learner Journey Overview

# Getting Started

Each Lambda School start date is comprised of new sections (also called cohorts) beginning across different courses. The section/cohort a Learner is in will be titled with a course abbreviation and the current iteration (eg. WEB24).

# Breaking Down the Curriculum

- Each course has a "core" **_Track_** of curriculum.
  - The core track = 4 **_Units_**
- Each Unit is made up of 4 **_Sprints_**.
  - In part-time courses, one Sprint is covered over the course of two weeks.
  - In full-time courses, one Sprint is covered over the course of one week.
  - In most courses, the fourth Sprint of every Unit will be a **Build** Sprint.
- Each Sprint is made up of 4 **_Modules_** and culminates with a **_Sprint Challenge._**
  - Every Module is made up of Guided Projects and Project Time.
  - Each Sprint Challenge combines the objectives from every module so that Learners can demonstrate their mastery of those objectives.

### Sprint 1-16 = Core Track

- Covers all of the content from the core track curriculum.
- Includes 4 Build Sprints during which learners apply the concepts they learned and assess mastery.

### Sprint 17-20 = Computer Science

- Supporting content to make the Learner stronger and more hirable.
  - Web and Data science learners complete Computer Science.

### Sprint 21-24 = Labs

- Participate in our in-house apprenticeship by building a real-world project in a small team
- The work includes customer discovery, feature and planning, and delivery. Most teams will contribute to an existing codebase adding new features, and fixing bugs.

### Job Search Support

- Continuing education and ongoing Job Search support with Career Coaches.

# Progress Requirements

**_Please note that we are in the process of updating the Learner Guide to reflect all noticed changes. If you have any questions, please reach out._**

To progress through each unit, Learners must demonstrate mastery over all sprints, including [Build Sprint](Build%20Sprints%20d0b13fb5f2b5447f846c56cc7a2ddcb1.md), and pass an assessment before progressing. Not passing two or more sprints may result in the Learner Flexing to the appropriate unit to repeat the content. If a Learner is unable to pass the unit after two attempts, the Learner may be withdrawn.

Once Learners have successfully obtained the objectives within a core track, they will proceed to Computer Science and then Labs. After completing Labs, Learners have officially graduated from Lambda and move into Job Search Support.
