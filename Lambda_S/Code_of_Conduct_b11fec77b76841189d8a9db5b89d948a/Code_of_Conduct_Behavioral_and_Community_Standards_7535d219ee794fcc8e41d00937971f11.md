# Code of Conduct: Behavioral and Community Standards

<aside>
ðŸŒŸ One of Lambda School's most important jobs is building and maintaining a strong, supportive, positive learning environment that leads to successful career outcomes for all Lambda School Learners. Lambda School takes that job very seriously. Any activity (creating distractions, bullying, harassment, etc.) that negatively impacts the learning environment may result in being removed from the program. If removed from the School for violations of the Learner Guide, Code of Conduct, Enrollment Agreement or other published policies, the learner may qualify for a proration of their income share agreement (ISA) or retail installment contract (RIC), or partial upfront or installment plan tuition refund. Personalized information about tuition options and related policies can be found on a learner's MyLambda page.

## Professionalism and Respect

Lambda School is a professional environment. It is expected that Learners act accordingly. Punctuality, timeliness, accountability, and open communication are crucial not only for a Learner's success at Lambda School, but also in their careers afterward. The professional expectations Lambda School requires of its learners are the same a learner's future employers will expect of them. Professionalism should be a theme that runs through a learner's work and interactions at Lambda. This includes communication via Slack, Zoom, content of a learner's work, and naming conventions. A good rule of thumb is: if a Learner wouldnâ€™t do or say it in front of an employer or colleagues at their job, they shouldn't do it here at Lambda School.

Lambda School is fortunate to have Learners, instructors, and staff from extremely diverse backgrounds. Contribute to creating a positive experience for everyone by being respectful in communication. Learners are expected to do their part to make Lambda School a welcoming place to learn by encouraging their fellow Learners, offering support, and listening to others. Lambda School does not tolerate discriminatory, harassing, or insulting remarks to other Learners, instructors, staff, or anyone else, online or in person; for more detail see the Discrimination and Harassment policy below.

## Alcohol and Other Drugs

Learners are expected to abide by local laws and regulations regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs. In addition, the following are considered violations if a learner does so while participating in Lambda School programs and activities:

- Consuming alcohol and other drugs during school hours. Other drugs include, but are not limited to, cannabis (in all forms), controlled substances, prescriptions (when used in any manner and/or by any person other than what has been prescribed by a medical professional), and the use of synthetic or natural substances ingested for an intoxication effect.
- Use or display of drug paraphernalia, including but not limited to items or objects used or designed for inhaling, ingesting, or otherwise introducing drugs into the body.
- Disorderly and/or disruptive behavior caused by the use of alcohol or other drugs.
- Exhibiting signs of intoxication during Lambda School programs and activities.

When participating in Lambda School meet-ups, Learners who are of legal age to drink and choose to do so are encouraged to drink responsibly and arrange alternative transportation if needed. Please note that Lambda School will not pay for or provide alcohol for Learners during meet-ups.

If a Learner has a concern about another individual regarding alcohol or other drugs, they should notify the Learner Success Team via /frontdesk.

## Property and Resources

Learners are responsible for maintaining the appropriate security of Lambda School property, both tangible, like computers and tech equipment, and intangible intellectual property such as curriculum and content. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Lambda School property in the Learner's possession or control must be immediately returned to Lambda School upon any extended leave, withdrawal, completion, and/or termination.

Learners may not take, attempt to take, keep in their possession, sell, or attempt to sell property (intellectual or physical), information, services, or accounts belonging to Lambda School or other individual(s). This includes, but is not limited to, loaned equipment. Learners also may not commit actual or attempted damage or destruction of any property or item, including intellectual or physical property, information, and/or accounts.

## Weapons

Learners are expected to abide by local laws and regulations regarding the use and possession of weapons.

While participating in Lambda School programs and activities (lectures, support hours, study group meetings, etc.) it is expected that all Learners abide by the following expectations, regardless of local laws and regulations:

- Refrain from wielding, displaying, or using weapons or weapon paraphernalia while engaging in Lambda School programs and activities
  - Weapons include, but are not limited to: firearms, explosives, knives, clubs, martial arts weapons, swords, bows and arrows, hand grenades, or other objects that have been designed with the intent to harm another person or property.
  - Weapons also include, but are not limited to: pellet, BB, or airsoft guns, blackjacks, slingshots, Billy clubs, or metal knuckles (including replica or facsimile weapons), toy weapons, electroshock devices, stun guns, or any other devices that could reasonably be mistaken for a weapon or explosive.
  - Weapon paraphernalia includes, but is not limited to: ammunition, firearms accessories, empty holsters and magazines, and parts of a weapon.

## Discrimination and Harassment

Lambda School strives to create and maintain an educational environment in which individuals are treated with dignity, decency, and respect. As such, Lambda School will not tolerate any form of harassment generally, and in particular, based on an individual's protected status that is unwelcome and is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive; causes reasonable fear for safety; and/or interferes with or limits employment, education, or ability to participate in or benefit from Lambda School's programs, activities, or resources. Lambda prohibits unlawful discrimination against and harassment of staff, instructors, and Learners. Lambda School will seek to prevent, correct, and discipline behavior that violates this policy, and such behavior may result in withdrawal from the school.

### Discrimination

Discrimination under this policy is conduct directed at an individual or group of individuals because of their race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, gender, marital status, age, disability status, or genetic information that subjects the individual or group of individuals to different treatment so as to adversely affect the individual's or group of individuals employment or educational experience at Lambda School.

### Harassment

Harassment is conduct directed at an individual or group of individuals because of their race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, gender, marital status, age, disability status, or genetic information that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual or group of individualsâ€™ employment or educational experience or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Harassment includes any verbal, physical, or online conduct and includes, but is not limited to: slurs, epithets, or other threatening, intimidating, hostile, or abusive treatment directed at an individual or group of individuals based on the protected statuses described above.

In order to constitute a hostile environment, the harassment must be sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find it intimidating, hostile, or abusive. A single incident may create a hostile environment if it is sufficiently severe. Additionally, while a single incident may not be classified as creating a hostile environment, the incident will be addressed so it is not repeated.

### Reporting Discrimination and Harassment

Learners who believe they have been discriminated against or subjected to harassment in accessing Lambda's programs or activities based on a protected status or otherwise, should contact the Learner Success Team via /frontdesk. Complaints are treated confidentially to the extent possible.

## Retaliation

Lambda School prohibits retaliation against any person because of that person's good-faith participation in the reporting, investigation, or resolution of any alleged violation of the Learner Guide, Code of Conduct, or other published policies. Retaliation can be physical, verbal, via third party, or using electronic means, and may include, but is not limited to: harassment, intimidation, threats, or adverse actions against a Learner, staff member, instructor, or other Lambda School community member. Retaliation may result in immediate removal from the school.

## Threatened or Actual Physical or Psychological Harm

As a community of learners, Lambda School prohibits the following:

- Behavior that is threatening and/or intimidating, or harassing in nature and expresses or implies interference with personal safety, education, employment, or participation in Lambda School's activities, resources, or that causes the person(s) to have reasonable fear that such behavior is about to occur.
- Stalking, both physical and online. Includes, but is not limited to behavior that threatens or endangers the physical or psychological safety of a person(s), or creates a reasonable fear or intimidation of such a threat or action.
- Doxxing, which is uncovering and/or sharing a personâ€™s private or confidential information, often for the purpose of intimidation.
- Any act or series of acts of physical, social, or emotional domination or intimidation, commonly referred to as "bullying" that causes fear of or physical or psychological harm and/or interferes with employment, education, or ability to participate in or benefit from Lambda School programs, activities, or resources.
