# Code of Conduct: General Information

<aside>
üåü The Code of Conduct is set forth to give learners general notice of academic and non-academic expectations. Here at Lambda School, we are committed to the success of our Learners. That focus drives everything we do. Besides providing a clear framework, the policies and procedures in the Learner Guide are designed to mirror expectations our Learners will see in a professional or workplace environment. Additionally, we want every Learner at Lambda to have as positive a learning environment as possible - something we all play a role in.

</aside>

The Code of Conduct should be read broadly and is not designed to define misconduct in exhaustive terms. The Code of Conduct is an overarching policy that also includes all published policies and procedures within the Learner Guide. All Learners are expected to know and abide by the Code of Conduct and all published policies and procedures contained within the Learner Guide.

In addition, we may from time to time publish announcements to learners about topics related to the Code of Conduct. We will endeavor to ensure that updates are reflected in the Learner Guide, but overall, we expect that Learners abide by guidance provided by staff.

## Learner Rights and Responsibilities

At Lambda School, we value an educational environment that respects the values of individual Learners and their personal and professional development. We strive to create and maintain an environment in which individuals are treated with dignity, decency, and respect, and the best learning happens. Each learner has the responsibility to take an active role in their learning and understanding, and to contribute to an environment where all can learn.

As agreed to upon enrollment, Learners are responsible for reading and understanding the expectations and guidelines of Lambda School as stated in the Enrollment Agreement, Learner Guide, and Code of Conduct. If a Learner has questions about certain conduct, or whether an expectation applies in Lambda School's programs and activities, and it is not explicitly stated, they should reach out to the Learner Success Team via /frontdesk for clarification. Learners also have the responsibility to remain in communication with Lambda School administration, by checking their Lambda Learner email account, reading and engaging in Slack channels and direct messages, and reading all school announcements.

Lambda School protects Learner privacy. We do not provide personal information to non-service provider third parties except as requested by the Learner, or as required by subpoena, warrant, or as otherwise directed or permitted by law.

### A Note About Speech Rights

Lambda School has both the right and responsibility to maintain a professional, respectful, and learning-centered environment. Although we welcome feedback and ideas, as a private institution, we may remove content that violates the Code of Conduct or Learner Guide, is deemed to be disruptive to the learning environment, and/or is not aligned with Lambda School‚Äôs mission, values, and/or goals.

## Scope and Application of the Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct, along with all other published policies and procedures in the Learner Guide may be applied to behavior that is in-person, written, or conducted online. Alleged violations of the Code of Conduct that occur outside of a Learner's active enrollment at Lambda School (during admissions, Hiatus, or post graduation) are also subject to the conduct process, up to and including withdrawal from the program.

Certain conduct may violate the Code of Conduct as well as the law. Lambda School reserves the right to investigate and to initiate the conduct process regardless of the prospect of or pending civil or criminal proceedings. Lambda School's resolution process differs from legal proceedings in that the goal is to promote learning, growth, and to preserve the educational environment. Lambda School may move forward to resolution prior to, simultaneously with, or following criminal or civil proceedings. Resolution of an alleged violation will not change on the grounds that a civil or criminal case has been resolved via dismissal, settlement, or reduction.

Slack and email are our main tools of communication at Lambda School. We encourage Learners to engage in curriculum related discussions and ask for help through the appropriate Lambda Slack channels. While we do not want to stop the gathering of Lambda School Learners outside of official channels we cannot as a school be held liable for anything that happens in the spaces that we do not govern. However, the school reserves the right to further investigation and possible removal of a Learner for offenses such as bullying, harassment, etc. if such behavior is brought to our attention.

Policies in the Learner Guide, including but not limited to the Code of Conduct, may be enforceable for incidents that happen outside of Lambda School that affect the Lambda School community (for example personal social media pages, Twitter, Facebook, or in-person meet ups). The following criteria will be used to determine if an incident that happens outside of Lambda networks will be considered an alleged violation of the Learner Guide:

1. When the incident was recognized by others as being carried out by a Lambda School Learner;
2. When the incident adversely impacted the mental, emotional, or physical health, safety, and/or security of Lambda School community members;
3. When the incident adversely impacted the mission and/or values of Lambda School; and/or
4. Whether the incident was a violation of federal or state laws or regulations, or local ordinances.

## Process When a Violation of the Code of Conduct Occurs

We do not actively seek out violations of the Learner Guide or Code of Conduct. If we come across an issue, or someone brings concerning behavior to our attention, the Learner Success Team will work to determine if the behavior may be a violation of the Code of Conduct or Learner Guide. If a violation is alleged (or confirmed), we will generally:

- Notify the Learner(s) involved
- Meet with the Learner(s) involved
- Gather information about the incident(s)
- Work to prevent reoccurance

In most cases, Learners will be notified of the alleged violation (through Slack messaging, Lambda email, and/or additional email address on file) and have an opportunity to meet with a member of the Learner Success Team or their designee to share their perspective. Additionally, Lambda School reserves the right to immediately remove a Learner from the School without notice or opportunity for a hearing for behavior deemed to be disruptive to the learning environment and/or not in line with Lambda School‚Äôs mission, values and goals. Lambda School may also take steps to limit a Learner's access to the Lambda School community, for example Slack access, while an investigation takes place.

When determining if a Learner has violated a policy, Learner Success Staff or their designee will look at the information to see if the violation is ‚Äúmore likely than not‚Äù to have occurred. Determinations will be made by a member of the Learner Success Team or their designee. When deciding the appropriate action to take, we consider the severity of the incident, the context in which it took place, and Learner communications, if applicable. A Learner's lack of response to staff communication or refusal to participate in the process may also factor in the decision. Actions taken to prevent future occurrence may be educational in nature or may include actions up to withdrawal from Lambda School. If a Learner is found to be responsible for a violation of the Learner Guide, Code of Conduct, or other published policies, the Learner will be notified of the decision, along with any resulting outcomes up to, but not limited to being removed from platforms, repeating or reattempting academic work, temporary or permanent withdrawal from Lambda School, or other educational assignments.
