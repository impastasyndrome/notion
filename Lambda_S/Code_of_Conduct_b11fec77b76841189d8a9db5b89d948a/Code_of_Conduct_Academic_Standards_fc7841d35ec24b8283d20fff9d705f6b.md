# Code of Conduct: Academic Standards

## Participation and Attendance

Lambda School expects each Learner to actively participate in their course by attending all lectures, having an online presence during course hours, engaging with the Lambda community, and collaborating with other Learners. Active participation with the assigned cohort and Build Week team are required to progress through the program.

Learner attendance may be verified through engagement in any and all platforms used by Lambda School (Canvas, Slack, Zoom, etc.).

## Coursework and Projects

Lambda School expects Learners to complete each and every assignment given as part of the course because the concepts learned in one assignment are a building block needed for future assignments. Even if a Learner knows a concept, repetition solidifies the foundation of their knowledge. We encourage Learners to reach for stretch goals and practice on their own.

Coursework and relevant assignment and Sprint Challenge deadlines are housed in Canvas. Learners are responsible for ensuring that their coursework is submitted in the appropriate manner and on time.

## Owning your Learning

It is ultimately the Learner's responsibility to take an active role in their learning and understanding, alongside the structure and support provided by Lambda School. This might mean that to master material, Learners might put in additional study hours beyond scheduled class time. Or, that Learners might benefit from resources beyond Lambda School support channels, such as to learn another programming language or enhance their understanding of a concept and to prepare themselves. While we are here to provide support and assistance, Learners are ultimately responsible for their own learning and success.

### Asking for Help

If a Learner feels lost or is stuck on an assignment, it’s their responsibility to reach out to the Lambda school community for help. Learners may not always be given the answer, but they will be provided with the tools to come up with the answer on their own. Learners should use the following steps in order when they need help on technical problems/challenges and coursework:

1. Use the 20 Minute Rule (work on the problem on your own for 20 minutes)
2. Post your question or issue in the #help channel for your cohort
   1. Check your cohort calendar and Slack communications for formal help hours
3. Reach out to additional resources, with the understanding that these are not available 24/7
   1. Instructor for the unit
   2. Study Groups
   3. Pair Programming sessions

## Academic Integrity

Lambda School expects Learners to understand and maintain high standards of academic integrity. The goal of Lambda School is that our Learners learn the material to mastery. Asking for help and researching online are a key part of learning, and in the world of collaboration and open source, this can be tricky to navigate. Although you can search the web, read articles and documentation, and review code snippets and examples for help, you should be able to put all these assistance tools aside and write code from scratch. Learners should not submit any code or content that they did not write as their own work. For our purposes, breaches of academic integrity include, but are not limited to the following:

- **Inappropriate Collaboration -** Collaboration on assignments is prohibited unless explicitly permitted or directed by your instructor. Collaboration includes Learner, professional, and/or technological assistance other than personal research for inquiries.
- **Plagiarism and Cheating** - Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty that includes the wrongful appropriation of another's work, thoughts, ideas or expression. Plagiarism can include copying code or content from instructors, other Learners, outside sources, or generally submitting work that is not one’s own. Giving your solution code to another Learner to copy, or copying another Learner's work, is considered cheating.
- **Sharing Solution Code** - Lambda projects and curriculum are the property of Lambda School. Any unauthorized sharing of project solution code within or outside of the Lambda School community is considered cheating, and may result in dismissal from the program.
- **Inappropriate use of Intellectual Property and Copyright Violations** - We expect all Learners to respect the intellectual property rights of Lambda School, instructors, staff, other Learners, as well as those of any and all external parties. Lambda owns all code for Lambda assigned projects. Learners own any code that they write for projects outside of the core Lambda curriculum, even if these projects were written during their enrollment in Lambda. Intellectual property violations include copyright violations, using, and/or linking materials to which you do not have the rights. Lambda School may request that you remove any content or material (either within Slack or externally) that is found to violate any Learner Guide policy, contractual term, law, and/or any intellectual property right. Content posted to Lambda School Slack spaces also belongs to Lambda School.

For any project you are submitting, you should be able to set research tools and notes aside and write your own code. In investigating suspected academic integrity violations, the Learner Success Team may use the following questions to evaluate the situation:

1. Who created the original code and/or content?
2. For what purpose was that code and/or content created?
3. To what extent was the original code and/or content changed?
