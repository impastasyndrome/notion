# Code of Conduct: Digital Environment Standards

<aside>
ðŸŒŸ While these expectations apply primarily to Zoom and Slack as they are the main forms of communication for Lambda School, it is expected that all Learners abide by the expectations in this section during all school programs and activities, and on all Lambda School platforms.

</aside>

## Communication Guidelines

Professionalism is expected when creating and joining Slack channels, participating in academic and social discussion, and via posts, comments, questions, and responses to others. The creation of new channels is encouraged only when there is not an existing channel that covers the topic or interest. The creation of private channels is reserved solely for Lambda School staff and instructors. The naming of channels and content within is expected to be professional and in line with the policies and procedures found in the Code of Conduct and Learner Guide.

Lambda School reserves the right to delete Slack channels and content (posts, images, emojis, threads, questions, comments, and responses) that are not aligned with our mission, values, Learner Guide, or Code of Conduct.

Additionally, inappropriate behavior on Slack, Zoom, and other Lambda School platforms includes, but is not limited to:

- Calling attention to all community members using the @channel or @here function without explicit permission given by staff
- @â€™ing, and/or otherwise harassing, bullying, being disrespectful, inappropriate, or unprofessionally calling out individuals (Learners, staff, and instructors)
- Failing to follow the directions of staff or instructors (for example, continuing to post when directed not to)
- Being a disruption to the community
- Being disrespectful toward others (Learners, staff, instructors, and the school)
- Providing feedback in ways other than directed (for example, in channels outside the scope of where feedback was directed by the school)
- Spamming Learners, staff, or instructors
- Shopping for different answers (for example, sending direct messages to multiple staff and/or instructors about the same issue after already having received an answer)
- Using channels for solicitation/marketing of a personal business or for personal gain
- Misuse of channels - using channels for something other than the intended purpose
- Posting political content in channels other than #politics

## Use of Cameras

Learners are expected to have their cameras on and pointed at their faces while in lectures, breakout sessions, and conversations with Lambda School community members. If a Learner is unable to have their camera on due to webcam malfunction or unstable internet connection, it is expected that the Learner will contact the Learner Success Team. Issues such as malfunctions and unstable internet are to be dealt with by the Learner in a timely manner.

## Conduct on Camera

While the following expectations described here are under primarily for Zoom interactions, they may apply elsewhere in the program.

- Food: eating should be kept to a minimum while on camera and should not distract or disrupt others.
- Drinks: Alcohol is not to be consumed while on camera and is not to be consumed during scheduled school hours. This also includes having alcohol in sight or on display while on camera.
- Smoking/Smokeless tobacco: Smoking of any kind (cigarette, vaping, e-cigarette, etc.) is not permitted while on camera. This also includes chewing tobacco.
- Clothing: It is expected that Learners are fully clothed while on camera and that their clothing does not contain any obscene, offensive, or derogatory messages or images.

## Account Pictures

Learners are expected to add a profile picture to their Lambda School associated accounts. This picture must be a professional looking picture of the Learner's face. The picture may not be a caricature, drawing, or cartoon image of the Learner's likeness. It is not acceptable to have any other image for a profile picture in platforms used for Lambda School.

## Names

Learners are expected to use their legal name for Slack, Zoom, and all communication within Lambda School. Learners who utilize a preferred name will need to contact the Learner Success Team via /frontdesk so that we may update records.

## Safety

Lambda School is committed to safety and encourages Learners to take precautions at all times, including but not limited to while using Zoom. Learners should use Zoom to attend lectures, guided projects, and meetings while in a space where they are able to concentrate and not endanger themselves or others. We encourage Learners to use their best judgement and not participate in dangerous and/or physical activities while on Zoom, including but not limited to driving.

## Recording and Screenshots

Lambda School values and respects Learner, staff, and instructor privacy. It is expected that all Learners will respect this privacy as well. Therefore, it is considered a violation of the Code of Conduct to:

- Use electronic or other devices to make an audio, photographic, screenshot, or video record of a person(s) without prior knowledge or permission in each instance.
- Store, share, or distribute such records by any means, including the unauthorized recording of personal conversations, images, meetings, or activities.
- Create, store, share, or distribute created likeness of any person(s) without prior knowledge or permission. This includes, but is not limited to, emojis, gifs, and memes.

Please note that screenshots may be taken and used for the purpose of reporting behavioral concerns to Lambda staff. These should be submitted via /frontdesk, and not shared in Slack channels. Additionally, taking screenshots and sharing snippets of code or class material for the purpose of soliciting help or assistance in understanding a concept is permitted.

## Feedback

Lambda School encourages critical thought, discourse, and feedback from our Learners, including reflections on the school itself, our policies, or anything else. We value Learner feedback and welcome it anytime via /frontdesk, module reflections, communication with staff and instructors, and others.
