# ISA & Finance Information

## Overview

Students can elect to pay tuition upfront. Or, instead of paying tuition upfront, many Lambda School Students choose to sign an Income Share Agreement (ISA). Income Share Agreements are not debt, nor are they a loan. An ISA is a legally binding agreement representing a responsibility to pay Lambda School a portion of future income. ISAs allow us to provide an education that usually costs tens of thousands of dollars upfront for no upfront cost. Students may only have one signed and active Income Share Agreement at a time, including from other organizations. Note that for our international Students, ISA specifics will vary, and Students should read their own ISA for exact details.

## Key Finance Information For All Students

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If a student enters into an ISA, the terms of that agreement define that student's payment obligations. A student may not switch from an ISA (RIC for CA residents) to a tuition installment plan once the ISA (RIC for CA residents)  is signed.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If the student obtains any type of financing (including an ISA), they remain responsible to Lambda School for the full tuition amount, less the amount of any applicable refund if the student withdraws or is withdrawn.

ðŸ’¡ Once a student enrolls, the tuition amount will not and cannot be changed based on any factor other than Sprints ended as of the time of withdrawal.
