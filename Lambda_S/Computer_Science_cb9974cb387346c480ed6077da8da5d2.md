# Computer Science

---

## Overview

The main goal of computer science is to develop strong, comprehensive problem solving skills through the study of classic data structures and algorithms. Working toward this goal empowers Learner's to solve arbitrary computing problems with which they have no prior exposure. This enables Learners to perform well both solving novel problems in the workplace, as well as challenges they meet in interview environments. Upon completion of the computer science portion of the curriculum, Learners will be equipped to quickly learn new material in the ever-changing computing landscape.
