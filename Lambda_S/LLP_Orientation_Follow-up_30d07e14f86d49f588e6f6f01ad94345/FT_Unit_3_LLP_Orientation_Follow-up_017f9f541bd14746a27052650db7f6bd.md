# FT Unit 3 LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship & Track Teams

- **How do we get our mentor and track team assignments?**
  You should have received your mentor/mentee match via a Slackbot message. For your track team, you should have been added to your track team's Slack channel by now. If you have not received either, please contact Front Desk.
- **Will we stay in the same peer mentor/mentee pairing across units?**
  Ideally, as a mentee, you will keep the same mentor in Units 1 & 2 and you'll be matched with a new mentor for Units 3 & 4.
- **Will our mentors decide if we need to do a sprint retake?**
  No, if you self-assess as not passing when you evaluate your sprint challenge with the objective-level rubric, you'll want to resubmit your sprint challenge by Friday afternoon.
- **Where are we supposed to make up the extra project time we are losing between meeting with our mentee & mentor and prepping for the LL track team meeting?**
  We worked with instructors, our curriculum team, your team leads, and ran multiple pilots throughout the summer and did not find a significant impact on students being able to complete their projects. A couple of tips and considerations as you work in the time:
  - Use your time with your Mentor to pair program and work on the project.
  - Use the same amount of time during the weekend that would have been dedicated to your 5th day meetings.
  However, if you find that not to be the case for you and you are unable to keep up with the work in the 14 hours/wk for part time, we want to hear about it! For you individually, and to help us make sure we continue to build the right part time program for all students.
- **What if we don't want to be mentor?**
  Lambda Leadership is now a core part of the Lambda curriculum and it’s not possible to opt out. We’ve heard from hiring partners about how much they value team and leadership skills in prospective candidates and have decided to prioritize the development and enhancement of these skills for **all** Lambda students to maximize your chances of landing a great job.
  We understand there may be concerns and bumps along the road given this is a new program, but we ask you to give it a fair opportunity and share any feedback along the way. Our commitment is to continue to refine as needed to ensure Lambda leadership is the best program possible to prepare you for a great career.
- **Where do we see our track team roles?**
  You'll learning about them in your Lambda Leadership Canvas course. The roles are described on the Track Team Roles Breakdown page in the course and you'll talk about them in your track team meeting that day.

### Other Questions

- **What forms do we need to fill out?**
  You'll have a module retrospective each day and a sprint retrospective each week. They are all integrated in Canvas now, and will show on the day you need to complete them.
