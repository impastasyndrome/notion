# PT CS Unit 2 & New Labs LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship & Mentorship Time Commitment

- **How can I be a great mentor?**
  We will run a weekly training for Mentors every Monday afternoon to help students develop the skillset. We've also included training and curriculum in the Track Teams hours to build these skills and get the most out of the mentorship program at Lambda.
- **Will we have the option to choose which module the student is on that we would like to mentor? Like if we wanted to mentor someone just starting?**
  By default, you'll be matched with a student who is two units behind you in the curriculum. In some situations, depending on numbers, you may be matched with someone earlier in their journey.  

- **So when exactly are we supposed to be doing our projects?**
  We worked with instructors, our curriculum team, your team leads, and ran multiple pilots throughout the summer and did not find a significant impact on students being able to complete their projects. A couple of tips and considerations as you work in the time:
  - Use your time with your Mentor to pair program and work on the project.
  - Use the same amount of time during the weekend that would have been dedicated to your 5th day meetings.
  However, if you find that not to be the case for you and you are unable to keep up with the work in the 14 hours/wk for part time, we want to hear about it! For you individually, and to help us make sure we continue to build the right part time program for all students.
- **For us in Labs, do we have to balance being a mentor and having an industry mentor?**
  Meetings with your Industry Mentor happen once per week on your own schedule that you work out with them. You'll continue to have a Technical Project Lead to support you and your team each week in addition to the industry mentorship.
  We've found a lot of value in continuing to mentor during Labs, as that's the best time to practice deliberate communication about code, practice mock interviews, and prepare you for your upcoming job search.
- **In the beta program, I had a student that was struggling A LOT & it was difficult to keep up with my work & continue to help her. What is the solution for this?**

  If helping your mentor is taking meaningful time outside of the allotted mentor checkin windows, let us know! There's likely an issue we need to dig into to better support that student. It's not your responsibility to get your student over every finish line, and we're here to help.

  There's a spot in Canvas every day to flag to us when your student needs more help than you're able to give. If you need something more urgent, you can drop it to Front Desk and we'll help the student get situated.

- **How will peer mentorship and track teams work with our TL groups?**
  If you're in CS Unit 2, you will remain with your TL group as usual and will not have peer mentees. If you're in Labs, you will join a Project Team and you will be assigned a peer mentee.
- **Where do we get the interview questions for the mock interviews?**
  You'll be provided these, as well as guidance on how to conduct effective mock interviews, in your peer mentorship skills sessions.
- **So, PT developer/engineer mentors FT developer/engineer?**
  No, all mentor/mentee pairings for PT students will be with other PT students.
- **Is LLP optional? Can I opt out?**
  The Lambda Leadership Program is now a core part of the Lambda curriculum and it’s not possible to opt out if you're in a participating unit. We’ve heard from hiring partners about how much they value team and leadership skills in prospective candidates and have decided to prioritize the development and enhancement of these skills for **all** Lambda students to maximize your chances of landing a great job.
  We understand there may be concerns and bumps along the road given this is a new program, but we ask you to give it a fair opportunity and share any feedback along the way. Our commitment is to continue to refine as needed to ensure Lambda Leadership is the best program possible to prepare you for a great career.

### Industry Mentors

- **When will we be matched with an industry mentor?**
  Labs students will be matched with an industry mentor about four weeks into Labs units.
- **If we have already been through Labs have we missed the opportunity to have an industry mentor? If so, is there a way to still sign up for an industry mentor?**
  We are hoping to be able extend the industry mentor program beyond Labs very soon. We will keep you posted if that happens. The industry mentor program is designed to be an eight week program that straddles four weeks at the end of curriculum and the first four weeks of Job Search/Lambda X, so if we are able to expand the program, you'd begin about four weeks into this unit.

### Other Questions

- **What happens with WEBPT10 students? We seem to be in an odd situation, were already done with labs, but have 2 months of CS left.**
  After your two units of CS, you should be ready for graduation.
- **How will 5th day work now that we won't have 5th days anymore? Where can we find more information about that?**
  Fifth days are more flexible now, which hopefully will be helpful for you. Some support options will be tied to the standard 5th day hours. If you don't feel you need to access that support in a given week, you're free to select the times that work best for you to complete your Lambda studies. You should still plan on the same number of hours you currently spend on Lambda over the weekend, but you can choose times that work best for you.
- **Are mentors involved with grading or helping evaluate the mentee's self-assessment? How does this work for sprint challenges and build weeks?**
  On module and sprint projects, we’ve added objective-level self-reflection questions that will help you best understand where you are, and give us a signal on how you’re doing and how we can help. In part, self-assessment questions will replace TL assigned scores, combined with daily checks for understanding and peer mentor meetings. If you need help, you’ll be able to set up a 1:1 conversation with an instructor or support staff to help you figure out the right next step for you, especially as it relates to Flex.
