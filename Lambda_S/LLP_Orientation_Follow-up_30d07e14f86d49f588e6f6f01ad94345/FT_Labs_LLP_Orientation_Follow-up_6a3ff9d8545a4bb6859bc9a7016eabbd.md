# FT Labs LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship

- **Are we responsible for creating zoom calls with our Mentees? Do we need to have anything prepared for the meetings?**
  The peer mentorship training sessions will prepare you with everything you need to know to conduct successful peer mentor/mentee sessions!
- **Will we stay in the same peer mentor/mentee pairing across units?**
  Since you're in your last unit of curriculum with Lambda, you'll only spend one unit with your mentee.
- **How and when do we get our mentor/mentee assignment?**
  You should have received a Slackbot message with your peer mentor/mentee matching by now. If you have not, please contact Front Desk ASAP.
- **Will iOS students have mentor/mentee opportunities?**
  Unfortunately, given the point of the program the remaining iOS students are at, we are not able to provide peer mentor/mentee options for the iOS students. However, you are encouraged to participate in the industry mentor program.
