# FT Units 1 & 2 LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship & Track Teams

- **When and how do we receive mentor/mentee and track team assignments? What do I do if I haven't received one?**
  You should have received your mentor/mentee match via a Slackbot message. For your track team, you should have been added to your track team's Slack channel by now. If you have not received either, please contact Front Desk.
- **Will our mentor/mentee, and track teams change over time?**
  Yes, they will, but our goal is to keep both as consistent as possible throughout your time. Your track team will evolve each unit, with students who complete core curriculum moving on and new Unit 1 students joining. There may also be times when we need to adjust teams due to hiatuses, withdrawals, or internal conflict. Minimizing disruption is a top goal, to make the track team experience as beneficial as possible.
  Ideally, as a mentee, you will keep the same mentor in Units 1 & 2 and you'll be matched with a new mentor for Units 3 & 4.
- **Will our peer mentors be on our Track Teams?**
  It's possible, but shouldn't be expected.
- **How are our peer mentors chosen?**
  Mentor and mentee pairings are guided by being in the same track (Web students with Web students, DS with DS), and at least two units ahead of you in the curriculum.
- **What do we do if we don't hear from our mentor?**
  If you haven't heard from your mentor by now, please contact Front Desk right away.

### Other Questions

- **How do we record attendance?**
  Currently, attendance is recorded by your submissions in Canvas.
- **Who will grade our sprint challenges?**
  On module and sprint projects, we’re adding objective-level self-reflection questions that will help you best understand where you are, and give us a signal on how you’re doing and how we can help. We’re going to start with those self-assessment questions in place of TL assigned scores.
- **Can we still go to our TLs for questions?**
  TLs will be providing support in the cohort help channels, via project Q&As and similar options.
