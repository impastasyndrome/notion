# PT Unit 5 (New CS) LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship & Track Teams

- **For those who only have CS left in the curriculum, who will be the mentors for this group?**
  From this point on, you will only have peer mentees, not peer mentors. Once you get to Labs, you'll have an industry mentor.
- **If we are mentors are we basically TLs?**
  No, mentors serve a different purpose, role, and scope from Team Leads. Specifically, we designed the mentor program to provide three things:
  - For Mentors: Spaced repetition and review of content you covered earlier to stay sharp throughout a long program.
  - For Mentors: The opportunity to improve understanding through deliberate practice communicating about your and your mentee's work.
  - For Mentees: A peer in the program who's been where you are before, can guide you to the right places to get the help that you need, and meet you where you are in talking through your projects.
  Conversely, Team Leads at Lambda School have had a robust set of responsibilities, including module and sprint check-ins, code reviews, attendance, grading, project reviews, support hours, logging student work for instructors, uploading class recordings, and many other administrative duties.
  One small, but deeply impactful benefit that our data shows TLâ€™s have got a lot from is reviewing and discussing code. By harnessing and expanding upon the benefits of code reviews for peer mentors, we are now able to offer _all_ students the ability to be much stronger candidates on the job search, and more impactful teammates when they're hired.
  To provide additional support, we're also hiring additional instructors for every unit, bringing on additional Student Success and Support coordinators, investing in new tools and processes, and expanding our industry mentor program.
- **How many people to a track team?**
  The goals is to have eight students per Track Team, though there may be slight variations to accommodate the fluidity of our student body.

### Time Management

- **When exactly are we supposed to be doing our projects?**
  We worked with instructors, our curriculum team, your team leads, and ran multiple pilots throughout the summer and did not find a significant impact on students being able to complete their projects. A couple of tips and considerations as you work in the time:
  - Use your time with your Mentor to pair program and work on the project.
  - Use the same amount of time during the weekend that would have been dedicated to your 5th day meetings.
  However, if you find that not to be the case for you and you are unable to keep up with the work in the 14 hours/wk for part time, we want to hear about it! For you individually, and to help us make sure we continue to build the right part time program for all students.
