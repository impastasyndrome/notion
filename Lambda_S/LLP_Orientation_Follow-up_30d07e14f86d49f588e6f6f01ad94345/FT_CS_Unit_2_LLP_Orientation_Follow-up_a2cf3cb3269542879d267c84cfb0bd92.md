# FT CS Unit 2 LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship

- **What if I don't have a mentor or mentee assignment message?**
  You should have received your mentor/mentee match via a Slackbot message. If you have not received it by now, please contact Front Desk.
- **Will Java mentors be paired with Java mentees?**
  Yes, we will always try to match Java/Java and Node/Node.

### TLs

- **Will TLs who are FT students also have mentees?**
  Yes, TLs who are FT students will have mentees because Lambda Leadership is part of their student role and does not conflict with their PT TL role. Since TLs' duties have been adjusted, it should be manageable to balance these roles. If you have any questions or concerns, your Student Leadership Coordinator would be happy to discuss them
- **Will the TL group schedule be adjusted to accommodate the time spent with mentees?**
  We designed the peer mentorship schedule so adjustments to the TL group schedule shouldn't be necessary. Your TL groups meet at 4 PM, so don't conflict with the mentorship time.
