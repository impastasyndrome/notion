# FT Unit 4 LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship

- I was assigned two mentees. Is there guidance on how to manage multiple 1:1 meetings?
  First of all, please contact Front Desk to ensure it's correct you were assigned two mentees. It may happen sometimes, but is pretty rare. If you do have two mentees, we encourage you to meet with them together, rather than separately.
