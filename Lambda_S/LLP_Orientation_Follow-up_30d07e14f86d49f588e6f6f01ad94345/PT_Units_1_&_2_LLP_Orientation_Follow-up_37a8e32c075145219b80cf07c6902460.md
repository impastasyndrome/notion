# PT Units 1 & 2 LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Peer Mentorship & Track Teams

- **When and how do we receive mentor/mentee and track team assignments? What do I do if I haven't received one?**
  You should receive your assignments today. If you haven't received any info by end of day, let us know via Front Desk and we'll look into it asap.
- **What do we do if we don't hear from our mentor?**
  If you've tried to connect with your mentor haven't heard from them yet, please contact Front Desk right away.
- **Once we have a mentor and a mentee, how many meetings will we have in each module?**
  You'll meet four times per module, including your mock interview and sprint challenge review.
- **Will our mentor/mentee, and track teams change over time??**
  Yes. You will have at least four different mentors from Unit 1 through Labs and at least five different mentees. Your track team should remain the same until CS, at which point you'll transition to a CS-specific track team. In Labs, you'll join a Project Team.
- **How many people per track team?**
  The goal is to have eight students, two from each unit, in each Track Team. We may have slight variations to accommodate our fluid student body.  

- **Will we be in Build Week with our track team?**
  That's the plan! The idea is that Track Teams will allow your group to get to know other another over time and more easily jump right into collaboration during Build Weeks.
- **When do track teams start?**
  You will be matched to your Track Team and will kick off your first meeting this week.

### Other Questions

- **Who will grade our sprint challenges?**
  On module and sprint projects, we’re adding objective-level self-reflection questions that will help you best understand where you are, and give us a signal on how you’re doing and how we can help. In part, self-assessment questions will replace TL assigned scores, combined with daily checks for understanding and peer mentor meetings. If you need help, you’ll be able to set up a 1:1 conversation with an instructor or support staff to help you figure out the right next step for you, especially as it relates to Flex.
