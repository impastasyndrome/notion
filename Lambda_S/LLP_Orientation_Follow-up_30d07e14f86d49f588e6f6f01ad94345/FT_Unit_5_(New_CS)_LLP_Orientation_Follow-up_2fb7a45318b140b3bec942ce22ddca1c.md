# FT Unit 5 (New CS) LLP Orientation Follow-up

### Mentorship Time Commitment, Quality, and Accountability

- **How can we use the Mentor program positively for our career goals?**
  Great question! We've built a lot of what you need to know in the training and development you'll get as part of the mentor program, but to add a few notes here â€“ we want students to get three main things out of mentoring other students:
  - Deliberate practice reasoning about and talking about code. This has a huge benefit to the interview processes you'll go through on the job hunt, and better prepare you for Build Weeks, Labs, and the teams you'll work on when you land a job.
  - Spaced repetition and review of content. It can be hard to remember everything, but getting a mini-refresher 2-3 months after you've seen something is a great way to reinforce and help you re-apply in a new context. It'll have the side benefit of attacking imposter syndrome to see how far you've come in 3 months.
  - The perspective of the senior engineers you'll work with when you land a job. The experience on the other side of the table will help you learn how to be a good mentee and teammate in a new environment.
  We've also found that listing mentorship experience in applications and on your resume drives really positive conversations in interviews and leads to students getting hired more often. Positively driving career goals is _the_ reason we built the Mentor program into the program.
- **How do I best prepare to be a good mentor, so that I get the most out of this experience?**
  We will run a weekly training for Mentorship every Monday afternoon to help students develop the skillset. We've also included training and curriculum in the Track Teams hours to build these skills and get the most out of the mentorship program at Lambda.
- **Who keeps the mentor and mentee accountable?**
  Our Student Success and Student Leadership teams, as well as instructors, are here to help with any issues with mentors and mentees.
- **Students with bad anxiety may struggle greatly with mentorship, how does this program address that? This could adversely affect students with bad anxiety.**
  We specifically tested the program with staff members and students with anxiety. It's not easy, but it is designed to help prepare you to be successful in higher stress scenarios like networking, interviewing, starting a new job with a new team, all potentially high anxiety scenarios that involve working with people and communicating clearly.
  Peer mentorship and the track teams are meant to give you a safe space to practice and get comfortable with those interactions that will be required to eventually get a job where there is much lower risk, so you can grow and get feedback before you reach that point.
  That way, when you're doing the real thing, you've had the preparation, practice, and the confidence to walk into those interviews knowing you have the skills to talk through and impress with your knowledge. If you need guidance or coaching as you go through the program, we have folks on our Student Leadership team who've specifically trained in this and would love to help.
- **For students that are not eligible for the mentor/mentee program - is there anything being offered/available to them to make up for this deficit?**
  This would apply to very few students, but we know there are some and we'd love to help you out if you're interested. Please reach out to Front Desk and we'll work with you to find the best solution.
- **If we have next to no time to add something to our plate like the Mentorship program, what are your tips on finding the time/ability to do so?**
  Full time cohorts run from 8-5 Pacific, and we design within those hours. Lambda Leadership is now a first-class part of the program, and we've made tradeoffs within the school schedule to build it in. If you have personal scheduling conflicts with the full time class or your mentor hours, please reach out to Front Desk and we'll see if we can work something out with you.

### Program Quality

- **How do you expect the quality of education to not decline when moving away from a voluntary teaching program like the TL positions? Teaching is not for everyone.**

  Each of the changes we are making this fall are based on [modern research around social learning](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/search/index.asp?q=peer+mentor&btnG=Search&showall=1), successful online learning environments, and our experience running pilots through the summer. As with all change, we'll have to learn and adapt as we sand off rough edges, but peer mentoring is a proven practice that improves learning for both the mentee and the mentor.

  We understand teaching is not for everyone. But we are not asking mentors to teach. Instead, we're asking them to engage in conversation around code and content. Being able to communicate, ask questions and have constructive conversations around what you're building is critical to getting a job and succeeding once you get there.

- **Isn't the new program teaching to the test (interview) instead of teaching strong DS and Web engineers with a solid foundation of skills?**
  We made an intentional choice to focus on the computer science skills that students are expected to have in their interviews and early on the job and get students onto the job search sooner rather than later. We were able to do that by dropping two Build Week sprints, consolidating an additional sprint, and dropping a more advanced sprint that was not directly driving to student outcomes.
  We're still covering critical foundational skills that will differentiate you on the job search, but doing that in a more focused way. If you want to keep the original extra time, you can opt in to the longer version of Computer Science up to your second sprint in Labs.
- **How is 2 teachers for upwards of 100 students better than a pre recorded video and personal available help from a TL per 3-4 students.**
  Teachers are at their best when they're answering the questions that only they can answer.
- **So I was under the assumption that there would be less forms to fill out, when I see that there are more forms to be filled out, and more for us to do? Yes?**
  Due to the way Canvas treats different types of questions, we broke out some of the existing forms into multiple steps that are done at the right time of day, instead of everything at the end. So it looks like a much higher number, but should be fewer overall questions. Multiple sections are optional based on what you've done that day.
  That said, as we built out the courses we noted there were a lot of new questions, and we're reevaluating as a team what we need vs what is nice to have, and how frequently we need to ask the different questions. So expect to see optimization over time.

### Other Questions

- I**n the interest of transparency, can you share the data you reference that's driving this change so we can better understand the decision that was made?**

  We're making a number of different changes this Fall, each inspired by different research and sets of data. Here's a quick survey of some of the leading areas for each program change:

  - Shortened School. We made the design changes based on nearly 100 interviews with hiring managers and technical leaders, a deep dive into the technical assessments and coding challenges that our students have given us feedback on, and based on student feedback that the length of the program too frequently led them to burning out or running out of financial runway to make the career change.
  - Career Services. The Career Services changes were primarily driven by user research with students on the job search over the last year under the new Outcomes team leadership. The two driving metrics that led to our changes:
    1. ~60% of students indicated that their lack of a good network was an impediment to getting a job. This led to us focusing on building networking skills and activities into the program.
    2. 18% of students who start interviewing at a company fall short at the technical interview stage. One commonly cited reason from hiring managers is that students can build projects, but are unable to explain why or how they got to that conclusion.
  - Mentor Program. Peer Mentoring is a common and proven practice at all levels of education and professions. Here are some links to some of the research papers we used to help design the program:
    - [Institution-wide peer mentoring: Benefits for mentors](https://espace.curtin.edu.au/bitstream/handle/20.500.11937/13607/189919_74249_72004.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)
    - [Peer Mentoring Freshmen: Implications for Satisfaction, Commitment, and Retention to Graduation](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Talya_Bauer/publication/211393584_Peer-Mentoring_Freshmen_Implications_for_Satisfaction_Commitment_and_Retention_to_Graduation/links/545ab98a0cf2c46f664387b5/Peer-Mentoring-Freshmen-Implications-for-Satisfaction-Commitment-and-Retention-to-Graduation.pdf)
    - [The Impact of Peer Mentoring on Mentee Academic Performance: Is Any Mentoring Style Better than No Mentoring At All?](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1043041.pdf)
    - [The Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) (Not an academic article, but a strong inspiration for the design we landed on)
    There are [thousands of great academic papers and research on the benefits of peer mentoring in higher education and professional settings](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C45&q=peer+mentoring&btnG=). Please reach out if you're interested in learning more.

  If you're interested in other areas or how we made these decisions, please reach out and we'd be happy to talk through more.

- **Can we change track teams?**
  We'll work with you based on your situation. There are a lot of variables that go into making each track team, and it's a learning environment for every student, so there are only a few scenarios where we would automatically change up a track team rather than try to work on the reasons why you're requesting a change.
  With that said, there _are_ scenarios where we will make an immediate change, including harassment or other issues around student conduct. Please reach out to Front Desk and our Student Success or Leadership teams will get you taken care of.
- **Is this something we can include on our resume?**
  Of course! Lambda Leadership is a huge part of the program that will differentiate you from other candidates. We're even including it as a separate highlight in our graduation materials and badges to help underscore that difference. You should too.
- **Are we going to be guided on how to go about doing the mock tech interviews with our mentee when we haven't had the most experience with them yet?**
  Yes. Every mock interview comes with a guide and discussion topics to work through and help each other learn about the experience.
- **Is the duration of CS36 still 4 week?**
  Yes, CS36 will still be in the new Computer Science unit for 4 sprints. You may opt in to the longer program during Labs if you would like.
