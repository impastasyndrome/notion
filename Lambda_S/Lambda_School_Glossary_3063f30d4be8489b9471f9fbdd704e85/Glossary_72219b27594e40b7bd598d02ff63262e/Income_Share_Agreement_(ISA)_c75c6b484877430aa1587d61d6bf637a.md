# Income Share Agreement (ISA)

Definition: An ISA is a way to pay your Lambda School tuition. A Lambda School ISA is a contract under which you agree to pay a percentage of your post-Lambda School salary for a set number of months, but only once you're making more than $50,000 per year (or the equivalent of $4,166.66 per month). The ISA is capped at a maximum repayment amount, so you wonâ€™t pay more than the cap under any circumstances.
