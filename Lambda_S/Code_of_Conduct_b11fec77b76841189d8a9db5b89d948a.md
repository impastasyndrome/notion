# Code of Conduct

<aside>
ðŸŒŸ The Code of Conduct is set forth to give Learners general notice of academic and non-academic expectations. Here at Lambda School, we are committed to the success of our Learners. That focus drives everything we do. Besides providing a clear framework, the policies and procedures in the Learner Guide are designed to mirror expectations our Learners will see in a professional or workplace environment. Additionally, we want every Learner at Lambda to have as positive a learning environment as possible - something we all play a role in.

</aside>

The Code of Conduct should be read broadly and is not designed to define misconduct in exhaustive terms. The Code of Conduct is an overarching policy that also includes all published policies and procedures within the Learner Guide. All Learners are expected to know and abide by the Code of Conduct and all published policies and procedures contained within the Learner Guide.

In addition, we may from time to time publish announcements to Learners about topics related to the Code of Conduct. We will endeavor to ensure that updates are reflected in the Learner Guide, but overall, we expect that Learners abide by guidance provided by staff.
