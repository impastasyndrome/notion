Since you’re graduating next week 🙌, Lambda Leadership and the shortened school schedule don’t impact you. However, there are a number of exciting changes that will impact your experience as a Lambda School graduate.

**Job Search**: You’ll receive dedicated support to help you land a job. You will work 1:1 with [a Job Search Trainer](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help), use our [Job Board](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/) to track your progress, and have access to Career Coaches and technical staff to prepare for your scheduled interviews. We’ll work hard to match you with job opportunities from our hiring partners, too.

Here are the specifics around what you can expect starting on 9/28:

- You’ll be added to a **Job Search Slack channel**.
- You’ll attend an **onboarding session** to learn about the Job Search unit of Lambda School. In that session, you’ll get information about your Job Search Trainer, just-in-time interview prep, weekly workshops led by the Careers Team, how to use the Job Board, and more.
- You’ll be matched with a **Job Search Trainer**, whose role is to provide 1:1 accountability, motivation, and quick answers to your job search-related questions. They’ll be with you every step of the way in your search to make sure you have what you need to secure a great role.
- **Career Coaches** will be available to provide you with the support and preparation you need to feel confident interviewing, negotiating an offer, tailoring your job application materials, working through roadblocks in your job search, and more. To see a Career Coach, you can set up an individual appointment or drop in to office hours.
- **Industry Mentors:** We’re expanding our popular [**Industry Mentorship Program**](https://www.notion.so/Industry-Mentor-Program-28782181f2e04060b266d447b10cdee0). Over the course of the fall, we’ll open applications to all graduates who are not yet hired. Working with an Industry Mentor will help you build your network and give you more real-world career skills. Stay tuned for more information!
