# How the US ISA works

Under Lambda School's Income Share Agreement, students agree to pay 17% of their post-Lambda School gross income with 24 monthly payments, but only when they are making more than $4,166 per month (that is, $50,000 per year). For example, if a Student gets a job paying $60,000 per year, they are earning $5,000 per month. 17% of $5,000 is $850, so they pay $850 per month under their ISA.

As long as a Student is earning above the minimum income threshold (the $50,000 annually), and is working in a qualified industry or position, they will make monthly payments of 17% of their income for 24 months. If a Student's income ever drops below $4,166 per month, they will not make a payment in that month. Our ISA is also capped at a maximum of $30,000. Students will never pay more than $30,000 under any circumstances. If a Student reaches the $30,000 maximum payment amount prior to the 24 month term, their ISA will be considered complete.

Students have five (5) years after their last day at Lambda School to complete the 24 monthly payments. If 5 years go by, and they haven't made enough money to trigger the 24 monthly payments, the ISA is cancelled.

# Deferment Policy and the Income Threshold

If a Student's income is less than $4,166 per month for a qualified position, payments on the ISA are considered deferred for that month. After that, if that Student's monthly earned income exceeds the $4,166 again, their obligation to make monthly payments is reinstated.

There is a 60-month limit on the aggregate number of months that payments may be deferred. If a student reaches the maximum number or deferred months (60 in total), payment obligations of the ISA will end and that Student won't owe any more more payments.

Important note: there are cases where, because payments stopped and started due to deferment, the total 60 months of deferment could be more than 5 calendar years from the date the Student completes Lambda School.

- **What is an ISA and how does it work?**
  An ISA is a way to pay your Lambda School tuition. A Lambda School ISA is a contract under which you agree to pay 17% of your post-Lambda School salary for 24 months, but only once you're making more than $50,000 per year (or the equivalent of $4,166.66 per month). The ISA is capped at a maximum repayment of $30,000, so you won’t pay more than $30,000 under any circumstances.
  This is our way of investing in you. We select students we believe will be successful, and cover your tuition until you're in a financial position to pay us back.
- **What is the true cost of Lambda School for students who elect to use an ISA?**
  Lambda School tuition is $30,000. You can elect to pay upfront or via an ISA.
  Because ISA payments are based on income and the maximum number of monthly payments is 24, any one student who elects to use an ISA might pay less than the full $30,000 tuition of Lambda School.
  - If you do not land a high paying job, you do not pay Lambda School anything.
  - If you land a high-paying job, the most you will pay is $30,000.
  If you use an ISA, depending on your income after completing your Lambda School program, you will pay somewhere between $0 and $30,000, in 24 monthly payments based on your income.
  After you reach the payment cap or complete your 24th monthly payment, you are free of obligation under the ISA.
  For example, if you get a job paying $60,000/year, you’re earning $5,000 per month. 17% of $5,000 is $850, so you pay $850 that month for your ISA. You make 17% payments on your income every month until you’ve made 24 monthly payments. The total amount you will pay is $20,400.
  Below is a chart illustrating the total amount you will pay under the ISA payment option in various earning scenarios.

- **Can I see an example ISA?**
  Yes, you can see a template we use [here](http://lambdaschool.com/isa-template) and a template we have used with Leif **[here.](https://leif.org/api/products/5b5b8bd0e59b743f9a086ed9/pdf)**
- **What are the interest rates for the ISA?**
  ISAs are not loans so they have no interest.
- **Is the repayment amount on an ISA calculated before or after taxes?**
  The 17% is a percentage of your gross income, i.e. before taxes.
- **When do my ISA repayments start?**
  Your ISA payments start when you’re earning $50,000 a year (that’s $4,166 a month). If you do not make more than $4,166 a month, the ISA automatically expires after 60 such deferred-payment months.
- **Who services the ISA? Lambda School?**
  Meratas is a third party provider who services the ISA on behalf of Lambda School in the United States. Leif is a third party who services ISAs for some existing students.
- **How do you verify my income?**
  The Income Share Agreement requires you to report your job status and income to our ISA servicing partner.
- **How do I report my income? How can I see how many payments I have left?**
  You’ll report your income and your job status through your account with our ISA servicing partner. Our servicing partner also provides customer support to answer more detailed questions.
- **What if I file a joint tax return?**
  The Income Share Agreement requires you to submit your tax returns to our ISA servicing partner. That said, we’re only interested in your personal income. If you provide documentation of your spouse’s income, it won’t be included.
- **What happens to my tuition if I withdraw from Lambda School?**
  We reduce the total obligation for people who leave Lambda School, based on completion of sprints. For full-time students, a sprint is one week long. For part-time students, a sprint is two weeks long.
  The timing for when your tuition and/or ISA may be canceled completely, versus pro-rated, versus fully due may vary by state depending on the rules in your state. Please see your Enrollment Agreement for the most up-to-date information. In every state, you can cancel your ISA within 4 weeks of your cohort start date.
- **Can I pay tuition upfront instead of signing an ISA?**
  Yes. On the admissions application, there’s a box to check to tell us you’d like to pay upfront, instead of signing an ISA. You can make this election up until the first day of classes.
- **Do I need to be a US citizen to be a student?**
  Income Share Agreements are available to people who live in the US who are US Citizens, US Permanent Residents, or DACA recipients.
  Other people can still attend Lambda School by paying the tuition upfront.
  Almost all courses are taught on Pacific time so it's important to think about how you will adjust according to your time zone.
- **Can I sign another ISA with another school after Lambda?**
  No. Our ISA requires that you sign no other ISAs. (Also we want to make sure you get a job, not go on to more school.)
- **When in the month are ISA payments due?**
  Payments are collected on the 1st of the month, and you will receive a starting grace period.
- **Am I eligible for an ISA?**
  ISA eligibility is not determined on the basis of prior income, sex, race, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or protected class. There are certain minimum requirements to be eligible for an ISA. For example, ISAs are only available to people who live in the US who are US Citizens, US Permanent Residents, or DACA recipients. ISAs are also not available to individuals who already have an obligation to pay under an ISA with another institution.
- **What agreement(s) will I sign with Lambda School?**
  To enroll, you’ll sign an Enrollment Agreement with Lambda School that lays out the basics of the program you’ll take as well as key items to know. If you elect the ISA option, you’ll also sign an income share agreement contract prior to starting at Lambda School.
- **What options do I have if I experience financial hardship?**

  The Lambda School ISA has built-in protection for financial hardship. Should you lose your job or should your income drop below $4,166 per month, your payments will automatically be paused after you’ve reported the change. That said, we understand that unique and unforeseeable financial emergencies sometimes occur.

  In this situation please contact your ISA program manager (Leif at [support@leif.org](mailto:support@leif.org)) to discuss available options rather than letting your account go into default. While we cannot guarantee your situation will qualify for any changes or deferment, we want you to know that we want the best for you and your family, and will do what we can to help in times of extreme financial hardship.
