- **The student's right to withdraw or terminate**
  We are aligned for your success and support your every step, but we understand in some cases you may not be able to continue or want to withdraw from Lambda School.
  **You may withdraw from a program without owing any tuition or penalty before the last class of Sprint 5.** If you withdraw or are withdrawn between the end of Sprint 5 and the end of Sprint 16, you will be responsible for a pro-rata portion of your tuition and receive a refund for applicable amounts paid in advance. If you withdraw or are withdrawn upon or after the end of Sprint 16, you will be responsible for 100% of your tuition. See tuition proration chart below:
- **Lambda School's right to withdraw or terminate**
  **Lambda School can terminate your enrollment or withdraw you at any time for failure to comply with policies in the Student Guide and generally, including lack of attendance**. Note:Â Students may miss no more than eight hours of class per month. If you are withdrawn from Lambda School, the tuition proration policy will apply based on when you are withdrawn. This holds true for all forms of tuition payments and if you withdraw or are withdrawn. Note that depending on the reason for withdrawal, you may not be eligible for re-admission.
- **How to withdraw from the program and cancel your enrollment**
  You can withdraw by contacting the Student Success team via Slack at /frontdesk or by email to [cancel@lambdaschool.com](mailto:cancel@lambdaschool.com), effective the day of the clear message requesting withdrawal.
- **Tuition proration for tuition owed after withdrawal**
  If you withdraw or are withdrawn, we will calculate owed tuition per the chart below. Sprints last 1 week for full time and 2 weeks for part-time.
  The end of a Sprint under this chart means all the classes in that sprint have occurred (whether or not you attended those classes) and does not require a passing mark. There is no additional cost for participating in our Flex program, so repeated sprints from Flex are not counted twice.
- **How refunds work**
  Within 45 days, amounts due to you per the chart below will either be refunded directly to you if prepaid or, for ISAs, communicated to your ISA service provider for adjustment to your ISA cap (which is your tuition amount).
  If any portion of the tuition was paid from the proceeds of a loan or by a third party, any applicable refund shall be sent to the lender, third party or, if appropriate, to the state or federal agency that guaranteed or reinsured the loan.
