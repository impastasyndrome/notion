# Third-Party & Outside Programs

If a student obtains a loan from a third party to pay their tuition, the student will have the responsibility to repay the full amount of the loan plus any interest, less the amount of any refund. If the student defaults on such third-party loans, the student’s loan provider and/or loan guarantee agency may take action against the student and that is not action on behalf of Lambda School.

Students may have the opportunity to participate in third-party programs or sponsorships that contribute to the student’s Lambda School tuition and may involve their own repayment and/or other obligations. The student is solely responsible for any agreement the student may have with these providers and understand they may have other conditions or terms for which Lambda School is not responsible.
