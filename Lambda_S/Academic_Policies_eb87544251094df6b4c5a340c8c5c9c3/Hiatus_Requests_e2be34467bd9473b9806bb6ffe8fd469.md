<aside>
üìå **Overview:** Lambda School understands that unexpected life events happen. We can offer a 3 Sprint maximum hiatus to Students.

## What does "hiatus" mean at Lambda School?

Full- and part-time Learners who have an unexpected emergency event that will interfere with honoring their commitment to the class schedule may be granted a hiatus from Lambda School courses (e.g. divorce, familial bereavement, new baby, severe illness, etc.).

<aside>
‚ùó A hiatus is not finalized until a learner talks to and is approved by a member of the Learner Success team. To schedule a time to discuss a hiatus, please submit a front desk ticket.

</aside>

## How long can a student go on hiatus?

- **3 sprints maximum**
  Learners are required to contact Learner Success prior to a hiatus to gain approval for leave, to make arrangements for a return date, and to schedule regular check-ins during the leave.
- **Learners are allowed a total of one hiatus.**
  Additional leaves may be granted if approved by Learner Success.
- Where warranted , Learner Success may consider approval of a hiatus longer than 3 sprints.

## Military Deployment Hiatus

- Students being deployed due to military service will be granted an extended hiatus.
  - The Student will be placed on an extended hiatus for the term of their deployment.
  - There will be no re-application process to return from a deployment hiatus.
  - Lambda School will work with the Student to assess and determine their up to date knowledge of the material and place them in the appropriate unit depending on the results of the assessment.
  - The Student's ISA pro-ration would pause for the duration of the deployment hiatus.

## Procedure:

- The Student must indicate the need for hiatus by submitting a ticket to `/frontdesk`
- A Learner Success Advisor will contact the learner to:
  1. Confirm and review the hiatus request
  2. Create a Success Plan with relevant return dates and conditions for success
- The Learner must check-in with their the assigned Learner Success Advisor via Slack DM or email weekly through hiatus
- A member of Learner Success will approve a hiatus status on a case by case basis. Upon return from the hiatus, the learner will be deferred to the section that will be covering the curriculum that was missed during their hiatus.
- Learners that go on hiatus but do not return to Lambda School will be withdrawn from Lambda School.

## What happens if a Student does not uphold their hiatus agreement?

Failure to remain in communication with Learner Success during a hiatus and/or failure to return after the agreed upon return date may result in a learner being withdrawn from Lambda School. Learners may qualify for a proration of their income share agreement (ISA) or partial tuition refund as described in the ISA FAQ section of the Student Guide.
