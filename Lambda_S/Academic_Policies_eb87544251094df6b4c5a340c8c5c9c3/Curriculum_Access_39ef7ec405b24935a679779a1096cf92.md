# Curriculum Access

As an alum of Lambda School, you may have access to past and/or current materials and resources (such as curriculum and projects) for the program you completed. You may use these materials for your continued self-study, to brush up on a new skill, or prepare for an interview or project.
Access to Lambda School materials is for your personal use only and may not be shared or distributed to a third party. This includes, but is not limited to alumni or students from programs other than your own, individuals/companies/groups not affiliated with Lambda School, repurposing or editing materials and claiming them as your own, or publishing materials or curriculum in any form on any platform.
Lambda School reserves the right to remove, alter, and/or discontinue access to this material at any time.
