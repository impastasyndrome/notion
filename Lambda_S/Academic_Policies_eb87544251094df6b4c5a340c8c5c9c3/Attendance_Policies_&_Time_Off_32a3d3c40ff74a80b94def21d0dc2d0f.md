# Attendance Policies & Time Off

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ **Overview:** Attendance is critical to Learner success in the program. In order to learn and develop their skills, Learners must be present.

</aside>

# Expectations

We take attendance to help learners stay focused and accountable - the instructor will share an assignment link and a daily attendance code. Youâ€™ll need to submit that code in your Canvas course for each Guided Project.

Learners may miss no more than 8 hours per month and are required to connect with an instructor or Learner Success Advisor regarding missing hours. Missing more than 8 hours per month may result in being flexed to a later section or being withdrawn from the program, this is determined on a case by case basis.

- US Based Courses
  - US based courses are taught on Pacific Time
  - US based courses will get the US holidays off listed below

# Absences

Exceptions to the attendance requirement may be made for extraordinary circumstances at the discretion of a member of the Student Success team. Lambda School allows for excused absences only when notice has been provided 48 hours prior to the planned date of absence. Depending on the circumstances, students may be asked to provide documentation from a third party in order to verify the reasoning behind the planned absence.

- Make-Up Daily Projects
  Students that have missed a live lecture, assignment, project, or other designed activity in the scheduled class time may make-up work by doing so outside of the scheduled class time.
  Make-up work must be completed within the week that the work was assigned.
- Make-Up Sprint Challenges
  Lambda realizes that certain circumstances may prevent a student from being present on the day of a scheduled Sprint Challenge.
  Students may request a different day to complete the Sprint Challenge if it is within three days of the original scheduled Sprint Challenge. This will be approved on a case-by-case basis.
  The request must be submitted via `/frontdesk` and approved by Student Success.
