# Academic Probation & Withdrawal

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ **Overview:** During a Student's time with Lambda School, Lambda School is investing in them. In return, Students are expected to uphold and comply with Lambda's Code of Conduct and academic expectations. Failure to maintain the Student agreement may result in academic probation and/or withdrawal from the program.

</aside>

# Academic Probation

Students who do not meet satisfactory academic progress standards may be flexed to a later section of the course.

Depending on the situation, a Student may be placed on a longer academic probation where they may be required to wait up to three months before rejoining an active section.

Students remain eligible to continue classes during the probation period and will be considered to be making satisfactory academic progress during the probationary period.

Probationary Students who do not meet satisfactory academic progress by the conclusion of the probationary period will be deemed not in compliance and may be withdrawn at the discretion of Lambda School.

- In the event such Student is allowed to continue with instruction:
  - Eligibility to continue will be reinstated only after the Student has reestablished satisfactory academic progress in accordance with the Satisfactory Academic Policy.
- In the event the Student is withdrawn due to not making satisfactory progress:
  - All policies regarding Lambda's refund policy will apply.

Probationary Students who meet satisfactory academic progress by the conclusion of the probationary period will be removed from academic probation.

# Withdrawal

A Student may be deemed to have withdrawn from Lambda School when any of the following occurs:

- The Student notifies Lambda School of their withdrawal
- Lambda School withdraws a Student's enrollment for failure to comply with policies, including but not limited to a Student's lack of attendance.
