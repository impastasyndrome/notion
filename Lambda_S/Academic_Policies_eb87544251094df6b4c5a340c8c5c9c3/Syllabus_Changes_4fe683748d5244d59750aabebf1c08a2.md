# Syllabus Changes

Lambda School moves quickly with a goal of keeping learners on the cutting edge of the field theyâ€™re learning. Within a program, Lambda School may make changes to the program, syllabus material, or projects required for future students. When appropriate, students may be offered the chance to opt-in to those changes. Lambda School will give notice of changes, and such changes are not grounds for a refund

\*_Please note that we are in the process of updating the Student Guide to reflect all noticed changes. If you have any questions, please reach out to /frontdesk._
