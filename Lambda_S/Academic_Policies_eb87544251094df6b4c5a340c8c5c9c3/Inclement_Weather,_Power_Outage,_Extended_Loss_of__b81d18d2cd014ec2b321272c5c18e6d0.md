# Inclement Weather, Power Outage, Extended Loss of Internet Access

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ When Learners are affected by power outages or loss of internet from inclement weather or other events beyond their control resulting in an inability to attend and participate, being flexed to another section may be the only option to ensure Learners stay on track to successfully complete the course.

</aside>

Where warranted, Lambda School may reach out to the Learner through phone, or emergency contact information to establish contact and verify a Learner's safety.

When contact is made and the situation assessed, Learner Success will make a plan with the Learner to return to class once the Learner's safety is obtained, and viable internet access is re-established.

If a Learner is in an area where there is an expected natural event, or have been notified that they will be without power or internet service due to conditions outside of their control, they should contact Learner Success via `/frontdesk to`

# Have questions?

Reach out to Student Success via `/frontdesk` on Slack.

\*_Please note that we are in the process of updating the Student Guide to reflect all noticed changes. If you have any questions, please reach out to /frontdesk._
