# Community @ Lambda School

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Building Community:** Learning in a remote environment can sometimes feel challenging and isolating. As a result, Lambda strives to provide community-building opportunities for Students to get to know each other, both virtually and when available, in person. We strongly encourage Students to take an active role in Lambda's community and participate in all that Lambda has to offer!

# Meetups

**_Please note: Meetups are temporarily on hold due to COVID-19_**

Lambda hosts monthly meetups the first Friday of every month. Meetups are an opportunity for Lambda Students and Alumni to come together and meet in person. Lambda Meetup Coordinators are also trying to reach out to local tech companies to network and set up in office visits. This provides the opportunity for Lambda Students to check out the developer ecosystem and become familiar with the profession.

Lambda has Meetup Coordinators in cities all over USA, Africa, Europe, and Canada. Want to find out where Lambda students and alumni local to a Student is getting together? Students can check out their local city, state or country slack channels.

- **_What are a Meetup Coordinators responsibilities?_**

  Meetup Coordinators (MC) create the Lambda Community in real life! Becoming a coordinator means the Student will help facilitate a monthly meetup for Students in their local area.Â The Student will initiate conversations with Students local to their area to set up in person monthly meetups.

  We love seeing our students coming together and networking with each other on zoom but thereâ€™s no substitute for meeting up in person. Thatâ€™s where a MC comes in!

- **_Hosting Monthly meetups_**

  - Meetups provide an opportunity to get Students from behind their computers and network with their Lambda Peers.
  - Typically requires 2-3 hours per month of time to facilitate meetups.

  Students donâ€™t have to do this on their own! MCs can Slack their local channel to find out where they want to have the next meetup (e.g. Escape room, Bowling, Laser tag, Axe throwing, local concert, go karting) and see what the majority would like to do and when. This can help MCs see what interests their group of students.
