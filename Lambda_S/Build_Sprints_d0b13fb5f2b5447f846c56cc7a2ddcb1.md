## Overview

Build Sprints, which occur at the end of each Unit, provide Students with a unique, hands-on opportunity to **apply the skills** they have learned thus far. In full-time, a Build Sprint is one week, in part-time a Build Sprint is two weeks. The hands-on experience will help solidify the content Students have learned in previous Sprints. Build Sprints also serve as an assessment tool to measure progress and mastery of unit objectives.

At the end of each Build Sprint, Students should be able to:

- Demonstrate and utilize the skills they have learned over the last 3 sprints
- Plan and deliver a project that showcases their work
- Demonstrate effective collaboration skills in a team environment where cross-functional teams exist (for cross-functional teams and group projects)

### **Purpose**

At the beginning of the Build Sprint, Students will receive a rubric, a role description, a list of features that will solve the problem or a description of the project that they are challenged to build, along with materials that helps them gain a clear understanding of the expectation of the sprint.
