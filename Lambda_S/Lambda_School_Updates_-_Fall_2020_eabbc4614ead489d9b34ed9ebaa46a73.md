# Lambda School Updates - Fall 2020

_Starting on Monday (9/28), many of the changes to the school we shared in our School Assembly on 9/4 will begin to roll out to Lambda students. Today, we want to let you know how these changes will impact you, since they will affect each cohort a bit differently depending where the cohort is in the Lambda School journey._

## _Lambda Leadership_

Employers are looking for new hires who not only have technical knowledge, but also the ability to communicate clearly and work effectively together on professional teams. [Lambda Leadership](https://lambdaschool.com/lambda-leadership) helps you build your leadership skills, strengthen your technical skills, and expand your network.

![Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg](Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c621a2fbc069a092b583_llp.jpg)

### **What’s changing?**

There are two main components to the Lambda Leadership Program that we’re introducing on 9/28:

- **Peer Mentorship** is designed to give students the opportunity to both be matched with a peer mentor and be peer mentors themselves. Research shows that this type of social learning can help students solidify their knowledge and build critical team skills - and that these specific skills are in high demand among hiring managers in the industry.
- **Track Teams** are made up of students from each cohort in a track, and will replace the current cohort stand-up groups. On Track Teams, students will rotate into various leadership roles. In most cases, the Track Team will become your Build Sprint team.

<aside>
💡 We’ve been piloting both of these programs for several months, and based on student feedback, we’ve made adjustments such as adding more mentor skills training and refining content for Track Teams.

📚 While we’re rolling out the Lambda Leadership Program this fall, we’re also in the process of **doubling our number of instructors across Web and Data Science** to provide extra technical support to students. These additional instructors will enable Lambda School to offer additional support hours and thematic Q&A sessions. Instructors will also be available to provide more 1:1 guidance to students who need focused support.

</aside>

### **How this affects you and others starting CS next week:**

- During the first sprint of CS, you’ll be matched with a mentee. As their peer mentor, you’ll talk through projects, questions, and practice technical interview skills. Before you become a peer mentor, we’ll provide training on best practices to set you up for success and ensure this is a valuable experience for you.
- **Please note:** If you are a part-time WEB or DS student in CS or starting CS next week and you have NOT yet taken Labs, you **will** be a peer mentor. If you have already taken Labs or are a part-time iOS student, you **will not** be a peer mentor. And if you are a FT iOS student, you will not be a peer mentor or mentee.
- As a student in CS, you’ll be assigned to a CS-specific Track Team. As a team, you’ll work together on CS-specific projects throughout the unit to maximize your skill development.
- Full-time students will receive a Slack message by Monday morning about their Track Teams and peer mentorship assignment. Part-time students will receive a Slack message on Wednesday before class starts.
- There will be an orientation for Lambda Leadership the week of 9/28 - stay tuned for more news in your cohort channel!

## _Shortened School Schedule_

We know that it can be difficult to take this much time to focus on Lambda School. Many of you are dealing with real challenges around how to financially support yourselves and your families, or how to manage other commitments such as child care. In response to your concerns, we’ve worked hand-in-hand with hiring managers to develop a new curriculum that can prepare you for a tech job in a shorter amount of time.

![Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg](Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c9eb80177e7d6a318be4_shortenschool.jpg)

### **What’s changing?**

- **CS:** We’ve updated and streamlined CS content into one unit instead of two based on what we’re seeing in industry. The new CS curriculum will focus on the CS skills you’ll need to succeed in technical interviews and early on in your new jobs. In addition to receiving feedback from your instructional team, we're introducing automated testing to all code challenges in CS to help you better navigate the automated technical screens that you may use during technical interviews. For more on what exactly is changing in the CS curriculum, [please see this FAQ](https://www.notion.so/FAQ-regarding-New-CS-Curriculum-9881388a95c24d388323e0b01a269aa4).
- **Labs:** We’ve updated and streamlined Labs content into one unit instead of two. Hiring managers overwhelmingly told us they are looking for practical teamwork experience over portfolio pieces - and we believe you can attain this experience in one unit.
- The updated CS and Labs curriculum allows Lambda School to be 24 Sprints long instead of 32 Sprints.

### **How this affects you and others starting CS on 9/28:**

- Students starting CS, like you, will complete Lambda School’s program in **24 sprints.**
- **As a current student, you have the option to opt out of this change and complete all 32 sprints.** The final deadline to opt out will be the end of the last day of your first sprint of Labs, but before that date, we’ll check in with you about what you’d like to do. **There’s** **no need to let us know sooner** that you’d like to opt out; we’ll be in touch with you when the deadline is approaching.
- Please note existing FT students who flex into cohorts that start on 9/28 or prior and PT students who flex into cohorts that start 10/26 or prior will still have the ability to opt-out of the shortened school schedule. However, we will no longer be able to offer opting-out of the shortened school schedule for cohorts starting after 9/28 for FT and after 10/26 for PT.

## _Career Services_

To support students in their job search, we’ve redesigned our Career Services to give students more practice with career-building skills throughout the program and after graduation.

### **What’s changing?**

- **Interview Practice**: [Practice for technical and behavioral interviews](https://my.lambdaschool.com/interviewing) will now occur more frequently throughout the program. The new CS curriculum, in particular, puts a heavy emphasis on technical interview practice through a combination of code challenges and whiteboarding sessions. Students who want extra support with behavioral interview skills will have access to C[areer Coaches](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help) throughout their journey.
- **Industry Mentors:** We’re expanding our popular [Industry Mentorship Program](https://www.notion.so/Industry-Mentor-Program-28782181f2e04060b266d447b10cdee0) so that all students can participate once they reach Labs. Working with an Industry Mentor will help you build your network and give you more real-world career skills.
- **Job Search**: After you graduate, you’ll receive [dedicated support to help you land a job](https://my.lambdaschool.com/job-search). You will work 1:1 with [a Job Search Trainer](https://my.lambdaschool.com/career-help), use our [Job Board](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/) to track your progress, and receive access to Career Coaches to prepare for your scheduled interviews. We’ll work hard to match you with job opportunities from our hiring partners, too.

### **How this affects you and others starting CS on 9/28:**

- Students starting in CS, like you, will notice an emphasis on technical interview preparation through code challenges and whiteboarding sessions.
- You’ll be matched with an industry mentor when you reach Labs.
- The Job Search resources will be available to you once you graduate.

In addition to the changes described above, you’ll notice a few other changes rolling out this month to support your learning experience:

![Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg](Lambda%20School%20Updates%20-%20Fall%202020%20d1eed9a6d9944ae3bac2f19ac45ae219/5f52c975c84b87b890d6ca62_canvas.jpg)

- We’ll be **migrating students from Training Kit to a platform called Canvas** to improve the curriculum experience. We’ve been piloting Canvas with select cohorts, and the pilot groups have found the Canvas platform to be easy-to-use and valuable in guiding the learning experience. Starting on 9/28, you'll use Canvas to find your course content, assignments, guided project materials, and more. You’ll also use Canvas to submit assignments, which will include check-for-understanding questions, self-reflections, and the ability to provide feedback on your experience. We’re offering training on Canvas tomorrow (Friday) for FT and Monday for PT cohorts; the details are on your cohort calendar.
- We’ve already **rolled out an [improved Flex policy](Flex%20327badd4502a4fc099db0effa1e69474.md) earlier this month**. Going forward, we’ll continue to iterate on this policy based on student and staff feedback. We’ll be in touch to make you aware of any future changes to flex policies or procedures.
- We’re **revamping our /frontdesk support** to ensure we can respond to your questions and requests more promptly. Please remember that responses to /frontdesk inquires will still reach you **via your Lambda school email.**
- Again, we’re **doubling our number of instructors across Web and Data Science** to provide additional technical support to students. These additional instructors will enable us to offer more support hours, thematic Q&A sessions, and 1:1 guidance to students who need focused support.

❓**What if you Flex and repeat Unit 4?** Don’t worry! We'll reach out to be sure you understand exactly what's changing for Unit 4 students starting on 9/28.

☎️ Thanks for reading - we know this is a lot of information! As a reminder, we’ll be hosting an optional Q&A session for your cohort tomorrow (Friday). **The Zoom link for your cohort’s session is in your cohort calendar.** In advance of the Q&A session, please add any questions you may have to the Slido for your cohort’s session (link is in Slack message and in your cohort calendar).
