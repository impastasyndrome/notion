# Find an example of a higher order function and a callback function in your project. Compare and contrast the two functions.

1: Student cannot distinguish between higher order function and callbacks.
2: Student identifies the higher order function that takes three paramaters where at least one is a callback. Code does not need to be perfect to get a 2.

Student can define callback as the function that gets passed into a higher order function and higher order function as recieving other functions as parameters.

3: Code is logical and succinct.

Student defines higher order function, callback functions and explains similarities between the two in terms of functionality and returns.

Student can define callback as a function that can be passed into another function as a parameter and clearly distinguishes between an argument and a parameter.
Objective: Understand how to write and use functions and callbacks
