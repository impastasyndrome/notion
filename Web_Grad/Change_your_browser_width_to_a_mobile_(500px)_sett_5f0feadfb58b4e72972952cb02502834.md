# Change your browser width to a mobile (500px) setting. What were 2 things you did in your code to make it responsive to the change in width.

1: Student is missing something important in media query such that switching browser width is problematic.

Student cannot score higher than a one if they use pixels where they should use responsive unit or uses responsive units incorrectly.
2: Student uses max width, min width, and responsive units correctly. Student understands basic principles of mobile first and desktop first design, but may not fully connect their code with these principles.

Student's explanation presents no red flags as listed in requirements for a one.
3: Student can explain difference between max width in query and min width - min is mobile first (scale up), max width is desktop first (scale down).

Student understands that viewport metatag needs to be in head for mobile browser to read media queries.

Student consistently and appropriately uses responsive units (rem %, vh, vw) and can justify why and where they use them.
