# Explain how you interact with an external data source/ service/ API and point to an example in your code.

1: Student may or may not be able to identify APIs and explain that they are external data sources, but understanding of CRUD does not go beyond 'GET' requests.
2: Student identifies external data sources as APIs and can find an appropriate and correct example of interaction in their code.

Student is able to accurately defines 4 terms (CRUD) and knows why they used the operations they used. [note: it is OK to ask students to define these if not in their first answer]

- PUT replaces records
- POST creates records
- DELETE deletes records
- GET fetches records

3: Student meets requirements for a 2 and uses well organized file structure, dedicated files for accessing endpoints and demonstrates an
in depth understanding of structure.

Pages making HTTP requests do so in a logical manner that is cohesive with the app's state management system.
Objective: Use RESTful HTTP methods to interact with an external data source.
