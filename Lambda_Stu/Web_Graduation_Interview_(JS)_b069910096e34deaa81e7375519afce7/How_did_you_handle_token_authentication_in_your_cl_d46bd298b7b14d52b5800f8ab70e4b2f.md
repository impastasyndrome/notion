1: Student has a vague understanding of tokens and authentication.
Student cannot score higher than a 1 if they only discuss server-side authentication
2: Student explains that tokens are stored in either memory in browser, session storage or local storage and explains what that means for their application.
3: Student demonstrates tokens stored in cookies or explains why this would be a better strategy.

Student explains client side treats token minimally and synchronization with server side.

Student's app can clear tokens on logout but not close as to keep access channels open.
Objective: Handle authentication with tokens in a React app
Topic: Client-side authentication
