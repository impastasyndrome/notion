# Explain your state management system and why you decided to use this system for state management.

1: Student may show use of a state management system but can't identify why they used it or any advantages of that system.
2: Student uses and explains state management that makes sense across component tree

Student used redux, context, apollo-client, or component state and can point to advantages of using their chosen system in their context. Student does not have to use Redux or context - plain old React state management is fine as long as they can justify that decision.

Student clearly explains how state is handled throughout levels of their system

3: Student uses and explains state management that is coherent at all levels including explanation of the following details:

- system has some global state (fetched a user)
- every component has information about said global state

Student can defend decision to handle state and component tree with redux, context, apollo-client, component state, or other researched thing over any other system. Student clearly understands both advantages and disadvantages of their decision.

Student clearly explains how state is handled throughout levels of their system.

Objective: Understand different ways to manage state and demonstrate appropropriate use of a state management system.
