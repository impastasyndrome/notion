# Show me in your Client-side App where you made an API call and how you retrieved the data from that call.

1: Student may have an API call in their project, but cannot explain anything about the syntax or doesn't explain promises

Student cannot score higher than a one if they are missing dependency argument (empty array) using the effect hook

2: Student explains how they used 'axios' or 'fetch' to access and return data from a specific endpoint (and understands, at a basic level, that an endpoint is where the data lives online).

Student explains the use of .then() and .catch() to handle promise data

3: Student designed universally effective functions to handle promise and explains how they could be used with any API request.

Data returned from the API was formatted to match the apps needs before it was set to state.

Student may have used advanced JS syntax like async/await with try/catch blocks.

Objective: Build components to retrieve data from web APIs
