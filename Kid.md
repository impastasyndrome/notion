### Mathematics

[Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) is a sprawling subject with many different pathways to learn and participate in it.

We recommend that you consider the date of publication and the source of the media when deciding whether it is a good resource for your child, and review everything first for age-appropriateness.

Software & Games:

# #Software & Games:

The [Software Kids Zone](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_kids) collection features vintage classics from previous decades. Please be aware that each piece of software will have its own learning curve, since you are using a keyboard and mouse to simulate different systems that existed in the past. If your cursor is "trapped" in a game,  hit Esc on your keyboard.
