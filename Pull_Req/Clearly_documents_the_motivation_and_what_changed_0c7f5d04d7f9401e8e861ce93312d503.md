# Clearly documents the motivation and what changed

1-3 (Not Passing): The PR description is either blank or only contains the boilerplate PR template or unchecked checklist items. Code comments aren't used, even when they would be helpful.
4 (Passing): The PR description outlines the motivation for the feature and/or links to a user story or other document describing the purpose of the feature.
5-7 (Exceptional): The PR description includes a clear rationale for the feature, or a screenshot showing either the intended state or completed state of the feature, and gives additional context about changes made in the PR.
Description: Is it clear why the pull request exists?
Does it link to supporting documentation (user story, product roadmap, design) to give broader context?
Is the code itself appropriately commented?
