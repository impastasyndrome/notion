Except for the fact that none of them have Facebook... this looks bad😂. One of them might but you might have to wait until Monday. I think I can remember him having a debate on Facebook with an old college friend. But before I do are we considering all ethnicities that have darker skin or are we just grouping African Americans as the black race. Because if that’s the case I do not have any African Americans in my close circle to be Trump supporters that comes to my immediate knowledge. They would be either Dominican or Native American.

I do strongly suggest watching the Hodge Twins on YouTube. Call it algorithm if you’d like but they are real people with real beliefs with almost 2 million subscribers. You can see their perspective from there. It is for sure the “algorithm” on why you haven’t seen them yet and to even think that an entire race dislikes a candidate just because of the color of their skin is outrages in my opinion and I’m sorry you hang around the wrong crowd. I would also like to point out and I’m not sure if I missed it because this thread is never ending but did you take the time to read my book I wrote debating all your points on why you dislike Trump? If so I want to hear your counter with valid factual information not media sourced. I no longer the news or mainstream media because honesty listening to them makes my head literally explode with the clear nonsense they talk about. They’re counter intuitive their stand on things depends on current trends with woke culture.

except when it comes down to now the city people decide how I live in the country. That’s when the line should be drawn and it hasn’t. Like I could honesty care less about who you support, what your beliefs are, or how you want to live but when you start forcing your way of life on me or even better, leaving the city because it’s too expensive and then start voting the same way you did down there up here just causes the same thing. Germantown used to be a small town where everyone knew everyone and it was affordable. Now, the prices have jacked up, taxes are insane and the costs of houses are insane. Forget about buy a small 2 bedroom house without spending close to $400,000. You look at what $400,000 can get you in a Republican run state? Like that would be luxury in New York. Yeah yeah, your yearly income isn’t the same but that’s because they’ve kept the value of the American dollar. People aren’t living off of minimum wage, which is another thing I don’t understand on how or why people don’t get this, but increasing minimum wage sure, flattens the curve for income but then raises prices for all on expenses. Just because McDonalds raises their price to $15/hr doesn’t mean that employer paying his employees $75,000 a year for a job they went into $80,000 in college debt for is gonna say, yeah I’m gonna bump your pay too to balance. No it’s just gonna raise the cost of every day necessities in technicality “lowering” the income of the individual who has a full time job. Minimum wage should be entry level high school. You should not be able to live off it.
