# Embeds

You can embed virtually any online content within Notion pages — from video and audio players to Figma and Invision mockups, to entire Google documents and spreadsheets. This includes streaming multimedia, PDFs, forms, and interactive maps.

# Examples & use cases

Here's an embedded Spotify playlist (it's playable!):

And here's a functioning Google Map:

In other cases, an embed will display your content as it would appear on your computer — fully scrollable — such as a web page or PDF:

With design and prototyping services like Figma and InVision, you can share your concepts with teams and clients for feedback. Here's how a Figma project looks on your Notion page:

# Embed types

While pretty much any online content can be embedded on a page, Notion has preconfigured blocks for these specific types of media and commonly used apps:

- Abstract
- Audio
- CodePen
- Excalidraw
- Figma
- File
- Framer
- GitHub
- Google Drive
- Google Maps
- Images
- InVision
- Loom
- Miro
- PDF
- Sketch
- Tweet
- Typeform
- Video
- Whimsical

Any of these can be added specifically from the `/` menu or by clicking `+` in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line. For instance, you can type `/tweet` to embed a Tweet, or `/figma` to embed a design from Figma.

# Insert an embed

- Click the `+` that appears to the left when you hover over a new line. Choose `Embed` or one of the common embed types listed above. Press `enter`.
- You can also type `/embed` or `/` followed by the name of the service (like `/figma` or `/maps`), then press `enter`.
- In the menu that appears, paste the content's URL or embed link.

- You can also use `/embed` to upload and display your own image, audio, video, or PDF. Just select `Upload` and choose the file from your computer. You can also use `/pdf`.

![Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-upload_file.gif](Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-upload_file.gif)

<aside>
👉 **Note:** Some websites prohibit their content from being embedded elsewhere. If you receive a `Failed to Load` error, that's why.

</aside>

# Embed from Google Drive

You can search your Google Drive from inside Notion and embed content without having to navigate away from the app. Here's how:

- Click the `+` that appears to the left when you hover over a new line. Scroll and choose `Google Drive` from the menu.
- You can also type `/drive` and press `enter`.
- A block will appear with a pop-up menu where you can either paste the URL to the Google Doc or Sheet you want to embed, or you can click `Browse Google Drive` to search your Drive for the right file.

![Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/drive-embed.gif](Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/drive-embed.gif)

- You can connect multiple Google accounts to embed files from multiple Google Drives.

<aside>
👉 **Note:** Previously embedded Google Drive files will continue to work the same way they always have. Going forward, if you want to embed a Google Drive file as an iframe, you can do so by adding a generic embed (`/embed`).

</aside>

# Turn a URL into an embed

In most cases, Notion will recognize an embeddable URL when you paste it into your page. You can also paste copied images.

- Paste the embed URL provided by the content's source.
- In the pop-up menu that appears, choose the `Embed` option.

# Resize an embed

Most embeds can be resized to suit their content and the format of your page.

- Hover your mouse over your embed, then drag the black bars that appear on the sides.

![Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-resize.gif](Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-resize.gif)

# Arrange embeds

- Use drag-and-drop to move embeds around your page. Hover over the embed in question, then use the `**⋮⋮**` icon that appears as a handle to drag it.
- You can also drag and drop embeds into columns.

![Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-arrange.gif](Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-arrange.gif)

# Go to embed's source

It's easy to link back to where the embed came from.

# Replace embedded content

As your project evolves, you'll likely need to update embedded content. You can replace both content you've embedded from elsewhere online, or content you've uploaded in order to embed and display it on your page.

### Replace online content

- Hover over the embed and click `**⋮⋮**` on the left or `•••` at its top right.
- Choose `Replace`.
- When prompted, choose `Embed Link`.
- Paste the new URL from the online service.

![Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-replace.jpg](Embeds%20ae7480f0d03a4e20a05ed7d7e616ef48/notion-embeds-replace.jpg)

<aside>
👉 **Note:** If the source of your embed changes in any way, that change will appear in Notion too. For instance, if a song is added to a playlist.

</aside>

### Replace an uploaded file

- Hover over the embed and click `**⋮⋮**` on the left or `•••` at its top right.
- Choose `Replace`.
- When prompted, choose `Upload`.
- Select the new file.

# Delete an embed

- Hover over the embed and click `**⋮⋮**` on the left or `•••` at its top right. You can also right click.
- Choose `Delete`.
