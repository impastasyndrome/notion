## 🛠 Set up your job search tools 🛠

_Optimize to start and end your day with the [Careers Homepage](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/)._

<aside>
⚙️ **Remember!** The Careers Homepage is your launching off point for more than just 10-10-10 — this is also where you will find new Hiring Partner jobs and resources to schedule interview or salary negotiation support.

</aside>

### Careers Homepage

- [ ] Make sure the [Careers Homepage](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/) is in a place where you can't ~~ignore~~ forget it
  - ⤵ **Ways to do this**
    - Set it as your startup page when you open a new tab.
    - Make it the only bookmark on your bookmark bar.
    - Set up an automated reminder to Slack the link to you every morning.
- [ ] Use your Job Tracker like a ticket board — at the end of every day, make sure you have no jobs left in `Applied`, all should be in `Reached out`.

### Slack

- [ ] Create a `Job Search` section on your Slack sidebar. [How-to here](https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections).
- [ ] Inside this section, place these channels and people and nothing else.
  - ⤵️ **These channels**
    - [ ] #job_search
    - [ ] #job_search_support
    - [ ] #job-search-product-support
    - [ ] #career_help
    - [ ] #gcastudy
    - [ ] #job_board and/or #job_board_ds
    - [ ] Your Career Coach
    - [ ] Your Peer Group Channel
      - [ ] If you are in more than one peer group channel, reach out to your Career Coach to figure out which channel to be in
      - [ ] Leave all other peer group channels

## 🍅 Get Comfortable with Time-Blocking 🍅

_[Parkinson's law](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-use-parkinsons-law-to-your-advantage.html) shows up in a serious way post-graduation. Combat this with time-blocking._

<aside>
⏱️ **Remember!** Time-blocking requires you to STOP a task completely, even if you haven't yet completed it. The goal is to increase productivity and decrease burnout, so don't push tasks beyond their allotted time!

</aside>

### **Three Methods for Time-Blocking Your Job Search**

- 📆 **Task-batching:** Create a calendar event for a set amount of time, name it for the task you are completing, and repeat daily. Hands down the simplest way to get some control back into your job search. [Task-batched schedule (full and part-time)](Organize%20Your%20Job%20Search%2022deda82a12242ee930275c7544b6d7c/Sample%20Schedules%20090e156220bd49438e34bb7421cd208f.md).
- 💭 **Day Theming:** Day theming is often touted as the schedule of [the Jack Dorseys of the world](https://lifehacker.com/give-each-workday-a-theme-for-productive-momentum-1644203340), but it is also quite useful for anyone with a lot of areas of responsibility competing for their attention. [Day-themed schedule (full and part-time)](Organize%20Your%20Job%20Search%2022deda82a12242ee930275c7544b6d7c/Sample%20Schedules%20090e156220bd49438e34bb7421cd208f.md)
- 🍅 **The Pomodoro method**: Good for the tasks that you really really don't want to do (hello, email outreach!). Pairs well with task-batching. [How-to](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). [Timer](https://pomofocus.io/).

## 📦 Clean up at the close of every day 📦

_Nothing better than starting your day with your to-do list set from the day before._

<aside>
🏃🏾 **Remember!** The job search is a marathon, and there will *always* be more jobs to apply to, more LeetCode challenges to grind out, and more emails to send. It can wait until tomorrow.

</aside>

- 🔁 **Anything you didn't get to the day before goes on your to-do for the next day.**
- 📧 **Check email and Slack before logging off for any communication about technical challenges or interviews.**
- 💡 **Be _very_ aware of what is consistently going on the "next day" to-do list.** Oftentimes it will be email follow-up. If you find this is the case, a) remind yourself that you don't have time to cold apply, b)revisit the [Cold Outreach Doc](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Outreach-101-9b887ce51ecc4a58bc972415fcf6e934) and c) challenge yourself to make that top of list for the next day!

## BONUS: 👯‍♂️ Find your Accountability Partner 👯‍♂️

_Now that you have your schedule, you need another human to check in on it._

<aside>
🚲 **Note:** You won't need daily check-ins forever — usually, about 2 weeks is enough time to set this habit with your accountability partner(s).

</aside>

### **Three ways to get another human to support your new, shiny schedule:**

- 👯‍♂️ **The paired method:** Enlist the help of a trusted friend, family member, partner, etc. who has agreed to check in with you daily on your job search goals. Show this person your time-blocked schedule and explain where they fit in: "**At 4pm everyday, can you message me and ask me if I applied to 2 jobs that day and if I followed up on them?**". Bonus points if this is either a) a direct stakeholder in your search or b) someone else who is job searching, too.
- 🎳 **The peer group method:** You are part of a small Slack channel full of folks who are also looking for their great new role in tech. Use them! Set up daily Zoom calls so that you all can knock out applications for 40 minutes together. Drop a thread at the end of the day to report back on goals hit. Reach out to your group's Career Coach if you need ideas!
- 🐺 **The Lone Wolf Method:** If you roam solo, you are going to need to build in accountability checks for yourself at the end of the day. To make this method work for you, you'll need to be either incredibly self-disciplined and/or able to convince yourself that the schedule you created wasn't made by you 😅. At the very least, make sure your Career Coach is looped into your goals so that they can check in with you weekly!
