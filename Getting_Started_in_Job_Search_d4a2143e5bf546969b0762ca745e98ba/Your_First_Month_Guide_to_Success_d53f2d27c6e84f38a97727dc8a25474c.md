# Your First Month Guide to Success

### üéâ Welcome to your first month of job searching! üéâ

_Finding a job requires a sustained and focused effort. Below is what we've found yields success for Lambda Graduates._

---

### ‚úÖ High Quality Job Search Effort ‚Äî Weekly ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Submit at least 10 quality applications + request a [Customized Outreach Message](../Getting%20Started%20in%20Job%20Search%20d4a2143e5bf546969b0762ca745e98ba.md) for each + track them in Job Tracker:** Quality application = one that is followed up with [an email or LinkedIn outreach](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Outreach-101-9b887ce51ecc4a58bc972415fcf6e934) and also hits the below points.
  - **What is a quality application?**
    - üëãüèΩ You have followed up with [an email or LinkedIn message](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Outreach-101-9b887ce51ecc4a58bc972415fcf6e934) to at least 2 people or 1 warm lead who could refer you. Use [Clearbit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearbit-connect-supercha/pmnhcgfcafcnkbengdcanjablaabjplo?hl=en) or [hunter.io](http://hunter.io) to send an email if they don't respond to your LinkedIn connection request (or are at a higher level - VP, Head of Engineering, etc.)
    - üÜï The job has been posted within the last 2 weeks**, prioritizing jobs posted in the last 24-48 hours!**
    - ü§ì The job requires 0-4 years of experience
    - üíª You have applied through the company website (EasyApply doesn‚Äôt count)
    - üí´ Take time to [customize your resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sssMyhQ2AYXBStfCF6fJPf1MPiJuPOu1_3DBBB03cCs/edit?usp=sharing) for the job description
    - üîé You have researched 2 facts about the company to use in outreach/cover letters
    - üìù Write a [cover letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAvzDaGEIOnPpXMVSpGM9QKm-UW1JzGu3yq1Exvb1Xs/edit?usp=sharing) sharing your experience and your research
- [ ] **Make 10 good connections + track them in Job Board:** via [LinkedIn/email exchange,](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Outreach-101-9b887ce51ecc4a58bc972415fcf6e934) phone calls, virtual networking events, [Slack group threads](https://blog.springworks.in/slack-communities-for-remote-workers/), etc. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Successful cold contacts from above count towards this 10!
  - **What is a good connection?**
    A good connection means that you have **received a direct reply** or **had a ‚òï - date, informal phone chat, Zoom call** from any of these people:
    - üì• An internal recruiter at a prospective company
    - üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª An employee at a prospective company (any engineering, data science, or product position)
    - üë®üèº‚Äçüéì A Lambda School alum who is employed at a prospective employer
    - üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A warm contact who is also connected to people who work at prospective employers to ask for an introduction
  - **What isn‚Äôt a good connection?**
    - ‚ÜñÔ∏è Making contact with an external recruiter (staffing agencies)
    - üìâ Submitting an application with no follow up message (just clicking ‚ÄúEasy Apply‚Äù
      on LinkedIn or just applying with the "Add a Note" on Angel List)
    - ü§ï Making contact with Lambda Alumni who are not currently employed at the prospective employer
- [ ] **Complete 10 code challenges:** Hired alumni consistently report that regular code challenge practice helped them convert any technical challenges that came their way. Aim for 2-3 code challenges per day or 10+ hours per week.
  - **How do I practice Code Challenges?**
    Tackle Code Challenges on your own AND in the weekly instructor-led code challenge sessions that happen in #job_search (Calendar Below ‚§µÔ∏è)
    [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bGFtYmRhc2Nob29sLmNvbV9icjhmc3RwZmM4Zm1kcjJ0NDhkOXFoODU5Y0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
    [https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice](https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice)
    [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
- [ ] **Attend your Weekly Group Job Search Support Session:** You will be added to a weekly Job Search Support Session where you will be joined by a group of fellows graduates and your Job Search Training Lead, Beto, to help unblock you and learn from your peers' job search experiences.
- [ ] **Attend at least 1 Outreach Power Hour:** These high-intensity events will be hosted twice a week with the sole purpose of helping attendees get as many outreaches messages created and sent out each week.

### ü§î How do I... ü§î

- **Send a Customized Outreach Message to a company contact?**
  üé• **TUTORIAL LINK:** [https://www.loom.com/share/5983de693024407f888d9b8e3694f3f5](https://www.notion.so/5983de693024407f888d9b8e3694f3f5)
  To take advantage of this, fill out the **[Outreach Request Form](https://airtable.com/shrDZgl0o92rMugIh)** with a link to a job description and some quick reasons on why you are a good fit. Our team will send you the email address and a customized 3-email sequence outreach to send. The form should take you <5 minutes to fill out and once you submit it you will get the outreach document within 1-2 business days.
  ü•ó Food for thought: If you spend 1-2 hours finding 10 job openings you are interested in and 1 hour filling out an [**Outreach Request Form**](https://airtable.com/shrDZgl0o92rMugIh) for each job opportunity, and 20 minutes sending the outreach messages, you will complete your expected weekly outreach goal in under 4 hours! ‚è∞
- **Know when to** **reach out to people (before or after application)?**
  On the whole, you‚Äôll want to get your application in and¬†**then**¬†reach out ‚Äî both to streamline the process, better track cold contacts, and to make sure you get your application in pretty soon after jobs are posted (being one of the first to apply + networking helps to¬†[get around the ATS](https://www.notion.so/21a173ab961c425985aec0553ba3edae)).
  **But it's a good idea to reach out _before_ you apply if:**
  1. You have a warm lead at a company already and think that they could give you an internal referral link or otherwise help streamline the process.
  2. You have a 2nd connection at a company (a friend of a friend on LinkedIn) and think they could be leveraged to get you on a phone call with them and ideally, get an internal referral.
    <aside>
    ‚è∞ However, don't take¬†too¬†long before applying directly. Give your warm leads ~2 days to respond before going forward with the application. You can still use them after applying to network in!

  4. Slack groups also are a good place to grab job postings before they get out to the general public, and then network in directly within the group itself, this guy swears by it :grin: [https://twitter.com/sethrosen/status/1290769636015972352](https://twitter.com/sethrosen/status/1290769636015972352). The people who post the jobs are typically directly involved in hiring, which is another great in around the ATS. (these include groups for all tracks!)

- **Find people to network with?**
  I'm so glad you asked! üòÅ This resource lays out how to find people, how to message them, and how to troubleshoot common responses. **Start here** ‚§µÔ∏è \*\*\*\*and if you have any questions, reach out to your Job Search Trainer!
  [Copy of Cold Outreach 101](Your%20First%20Month%20Guide%20to%20Success%20d53f2d27c6e84f38a97727dc8a25474c/Copy%20of%20Cold%20Outreach%20101%2050cf069a6d774668a98b05ccc57f45fa.md)
  Another great place to find people are online communities like Slack groups, LinkedIn groups, public Discord servers, etc. [This guy swears by them](https://twitter.com/sethrosen/status/1290769636015972352). Below is a running list of Slack groups, and always a good idea to search for local ones in your area as well.

- **Track a networking contact on Job Board that isn't for a specific job?**

- **Meet with my peer group?**
  Your Trainer will meet with your peer group weekly, but you can all meet as often as you like. If your peer group isn't meeting regularly and you would like to, reach out to your Trainer!
- **Indicate I have a technical challenge on job board and survey?**
  Track this as an interview on your survey and make sure it is marked as a `technical challenge` on Job Board! ‚§µÔ∏è

## üìÜ Sample Weekly Schedule

_Job Searching can be overwhelming, with competing deadlines and tasks. Use this schedule as a starting point each week, and reach out to your Job Search Trainer if you need any help customizing further!_

### üåû **Daily üåû**

---

**8:00 AM - 8:30 AM:** Check email, LinkedIn, Twitter every AM for any follow-up on cold contacts (remember to guide conversation to üìû call!) or interviews from the day before. Check #Job_search channel for daily events

**8:30 AM - 10:30 AM :** Send out applications (min. of 2 jobs/day). Track using Job Board.

**10:30 AM - 11:00 AM :** Reach out to _at least_ 2 people at each job you applied to. Move these jobs to the `Reached Out` column on Job Board.

**11:00 AM - Noon :** Lunch and brain break. Get away from üíª!

**Noon - 2:00 PM :** 2 \***\*Code Challenges or 2 hours of Code Challenge practice, \*\***whichever comes first.

**2:00 - 3:00 PM: "**One-to-many" networking, for example:  
a) attend [a virtual networking event](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/networking/)
b) contribute to a [Slack group](https://www.notion.so/Running-List-of-Slack-Groups-28a30bbe5605458e9819e5d47fc41b0e) discussion
c) create a post on LinkedIn
d) Tweet about your work! ([inspiration](https://www.popwebdesign.net/popart_blog/en/2019/04/web-developers-that-you-should-follow-on-twitter/))

**3 PM - 4 PM:** EOD Sweep of Job Board.

- Make sure your `Applied` column is clear, with all cards moved to `Reached out`. \*\*
- Save applications on Job Board to focus on tomorrow (or apply to them right then!)
