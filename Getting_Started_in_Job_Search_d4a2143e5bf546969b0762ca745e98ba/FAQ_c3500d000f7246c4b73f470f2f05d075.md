### CodeSignal GCA FAQ

---

- **I don‚Äôt have a GCA score. How do I take the GCA?**
  Use this link to sign-up with your lambda school email. You‚Äôll receive results via email after you complete the test and results are forwarded to Lambda. **Make sure to review our CS Lead Instructor Beej Hall‚Äôs documentation** [\*\*here](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/CodeSignal-GCA-Info#how-to-practice) as well as [CodeSignal's documentation](https://support.codesignal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040370853-What-should-I-expect-when-I-take-the-General-Coding-Assessment-and-how-is-it-structured-) on what to expect for this proctored test.\*\*
  Regardless of your score, you‚Äôll continue to get all the support you‚Äôve received in the job search. If you do not receive a 650+ score the first time, you can retry the assessment every 2 weeks. This test can be taken multiple times.
- **I previously took the CodeSignal GCA and scored below 650.**
  No worries! Study up and retake the [assessment](https://app.codesignal.com/get-certified?invite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) if it has been longer than 2 weeks.
- **I've taken the CodeSignal GCA and scored 650+.**
  Great! T[ake it again](https://app.codesignal.com/get-certified?invite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) as a higher score can open doors to more opportunities. Some partners/companies have higher score requirements. Regardless, as long as your student profile is complete, and your score has been reported to Lambda, you‚Äôll have access to hiring partner opportunities via Job Board.
- **I don‚Äôt want to take CodeSignal GCA.**
  You don‚Äôt have to! Work with your careers staff member to find external opportunities. Hiring partner opportunities are meant to supplement graduates‚Äô job search. There are many opportunities out there that don‚Äôt require a GCA score.
- **I'm an alumni. Do I need to take it?**
  If you would like access to hiring partners, yes! Make sure we have a score on file for you. You will also need to notify a Job Search or Careers staff member know you're a job seeking alumni.
- **I don't remember my score. How do I see my score?**
  When you complete assessments with CodeSignal you receive an email with a link to view scores via the CodeSignal site. Still having difficulty finding it? Ping a careers staff member.
  As long as you used Lambda's assessment link and your student email, your score will be forwarded.

This extension will help you save jobs you find online directly to your Job Tracker. It makes your job search much faster, so we highly recommend downloading it.
- **Where are the jobs I‚Äôm seeing on the Lambda Careers Site coming from?**
  The jobs come from the jobs you‚Äôve saved in your ‚ÄúInterested‚Äù column in Job Tracker. If you don‚Äôt have any jobs saved there, we will recommend jobs that we think are a good fit for you based on your profile and experience.
- **Where are the contacts I‚Äôm seeing on the Lambda Careers Site coming from?**

### **Partner Opportunities**

---

- **How do I access Partner Opportunities?**
  If you have a CodeSignal GCA score of 650+, you'll be added to a Slack channel to receive relevant partner opportunities. You can access then via your [Job Tracker](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/jobtracker)
- **What happens after I say I'm interested in an opportunity?**
  We will send your information directly to the hiring manager. They will look through the curated list of candidates and select the ones they are interested in moving forward with.
- **How and when will I hear back about an opportunity I indicated interest for?**
  We want to ensure we keep you as informed as possible throughout the process. Through Job Board, you'll receive a notification if they are interested in moving forward or if they've decided to go with another candidate. It might take several weeks to hear anything about an opportunity. Please be patient as we work through the process.
- **What if I don't use my Job Tracker?**
  You'll need to access your Job Tracker to receive opportunities.
- **Should I accept all opportunities, even if I'm not a good fit?**
  Please only accept an opportunity if you would seriously consider an offer. Ensure the location, role and skills are a good fit for you.
- **Will you send me fewer opportunities if I turn some down?**
  Nope! We want you to be selective when taking a look at our partner opportunities. If you're not interested in the opportunity, that is ok! We will continue to send you all opportunities as they come.
- **When I indicate I'm interested in an opportunity, how should I respond to the question "Why I'm a good fit"?**
  Your response won't be sent to the hiring manager, so you don't need to consider this a "cover letter". This field isn't required, however, we will prioritize thoughtful responses first when referring candidates to a hiring partner. Consider it an opportunity to share specifics about why you're interested in the role.
- **I'm having issues with Partner Opportunity popups.**
  Drop a note in the public Slack channel #job-search-product-support and a staff member will assist you.
