### What is cold outreach?

- Cold Outreach is the art of reaching out to someone who you’ve never spoken to before, in order to gain a positive outcome and generate a response
- This could be done over several different mediums, most commonly via Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, or a direct message in an online community [like Slack](https://www.notion.so/Running-List-of-Slack-Groups-28a30bbe5605458e9819e5d47fc41b0e) or LinkedIn groups.

<aside>
‼️ **Remember — your driving goal in cold outreach** **is to [get around the ATS](https://www.notion.so/21a173ab961c425985aec0553ba3edae)**. 
You want actual human to look at your materials and even better, hop on a phone call with you. When you don't know anyone personally at the company you are appyling to, cold contacting is the sharpest tool in your toolkit to get an actual human's 👀 on your materials and learn more about who you are as a candidate.

### The Process:

1. After submitting a job application, identify who to reach out to at that company. Aim for 2-3 people per company: 1) a technical recruiter or HR Manager, 2) a technical hiring manager i.e. `Head of Engineering, Design, or Data`, and 3) someone at the company who has the title you would hold (➕ bonus points if they had a non-traditional path to tech, but not a requirement).
   - **Small companies (10-250 employees)**
     - If this is a small company (10-250 employees)
       - It will be the most effective use of your time to email the leadership team about why you want to work there, why you’re the best person to fill the position, etc. and eventually asking if you would be able to interview for the role.
       - For example, let’s say you’re applying to a 50-150 person startup. It’s likely that the founder/CEO knows everyone within the organization, and it’s small enough for the executive to share your information with the hiring team.
       - If you do reach out to a founder, director of eng., technical recruiter, etc. — share your “Why”
         - What drives you?
         - What about this company interests you in working here?
         - Why do you feel you’re a good fit for the role
       - Other relevant contacts if you can’t reach the executive team:
         - VP/Director of Talent Acquisition
         - VP/Director of Engineering
         - VP/Director of HR
   - **Midsize and** l**arge companies (500+ employees)**
     - If this is a midsize company or large corporation (500+ employees)
       - The most effective use of your time will be to reach out to contacts that are specifically focused on recruiting, engineering, talent acquisition, etc.
       - The best “titles” to reach out to are:
         - Technical Recruiter (ideally finding one that specializes in early-career talent)
         - University Recruiter
         - Talent Acquisition Coordinator
         - Talent Acquisition Specialist
         - Engineering Manager
   - **How to source leads for cold contact on LinkedIn**
     **Option 1:** via LinkedIn
     **Option 2:** via Google search (of LinkedIn)
     site:www.linkedin.com/in -inurl:dir “ladder life” “engineer”
2. Send them a connection request with a note or an email (email has a slightly better response rate for Heads/VPs and Recruiters due to the volume of connection requests they receive).

### Outreach Tips:

- Keep it "Short and sweet” - shorter, concise messages perform better.
- The creative, yet professional subject line or first line of LinkedIn connection request
  - The first line of your LinkedIn message is the first thing people will see when they reach out. You want to leverage this space and customize it!
    ![Copy%20of%20Cold%20Outreach%20101%2050cf069a6d774668a98b05ccc57f45fa/Screen_Shot_2020-10-12_at_11.12.33_AM.png](Copy%20of%20Cold%20Outreach%20101%2050cf069a6d774668a98b05ccc57f45fa/Screen_Shot_2020-10-12_at_11.12.33_AM.png)
  - On email, the subject line is a big part of getting someone to read your email. If you can boost your read rate, your reply rate per mail sent will increase.
- Break apart paragraphs after a few sentences.
- Consider what this contact should know about you to determine if you’re a good fit for their open role and for the company in general
  - What makes you a good candidate for the role?
    - Do you have personal experience relating to the mission of the company?
    - Is their tech stack a great fit for your background and skillsets?
    - What are the problems that I could help to solve for the company now if I was in this position?
- **Deeper Dive**: 🗣️ What does Framing look like when you are telling your story to a potential employer?
  - Original Example: “I worked in a call center for 2 years, helping out customers with issues from products that they ordered.”
  - Better framing: “In this role, I spent over 2,000 hours on the phone with customers to solve any issues or problems that they may have experienced. I was able to interact and build strong relationships with thousands of customers while personally attending to their concerns.”
  - Replace “Call Center” with a restaurant, retail, service worker, etc. — it all works.
  - Ex 2: “I was in the military for 4 years where I served in the Air Force”
  - Better Ex. 2: “I served in the Air Force for 4 years from **_-_** where I was a _job title_, where I was actively stationed overseas for 4 tours of duty. During my time serving, I carried leadership duties such as “a, b & c” as well as interacting with local citizens to best protect my team and the local citizens from the country.”
  - Why is this useful?
    - Those sentences above are both the same thing - although one is much more complete than the others
  - Everything you’re going to say should be 100% true, but as in all life situations, there are many ways to look at one thing.
  - Framing is what you show to employers to get them intrigued in your experience, and shows them what your takeaways are from that experience.
  - Framing shows employers how you “think”
    - What were your biggest takeaways from this experience?
  - Imagine your words are paint, and you’re painting an image in the recruiters mind.
    - What should they know about you?
  - This is about influencing people to see your perspective and hear out the insights you have to share
