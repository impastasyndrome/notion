# Hiring Partner Opportunities

## To be eligible for partner opportunities you must:

1. **Complete your student profile.** Your [Profile](https://dashboards.lambdaschool.com/profile) needs to be up to date with your most recent resume link and LinkedIn url. Make sure the resume link share settings are such that anyone with the link can view it.
2. **Achieve a minimum CodeSignal GCA score of 650.** [Here's the link for the assessment.](https://app.codesignal.com/signup?certifiedInvite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) You can retake the assessment every two weeks. For prep advice view documentation [here](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/CodeSignal-GCA-Info#how-to-practice) and CodeSignals documentation on what to expect from this proctored test [here](https://support.codesignal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040370853-What-should-I-expect-when-I-take-the-General-Coding-Assessment-and-how-is-it-structured-).

     - **I don’t have a GCA score. How do I take the GCA?**
       Use this link to sign-up with your lambda school email. You’ll receive results via email after you complete the test and results are forwarded to Lambda. **Make sure to review our CS Lead Instructor Beej Hall’s documentation** [\*\*here](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/CodeSignal-GCA-Info#how-to-practice) as well as [CodeSignal's documentation](https://support.codesignal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040370853-What-should-I-expect-when-I-take-the-General-Coding-Assessment-and-how-is-it-structured-) on what to expect for this proctored test.\*\*
       Regardless of your score, you’ll continue to get all the support you’ve received in the job search. If you do not receive a 650+ score the first time, you can retry the assessment every 2 weeks. This test can be taken multiple times.
     - **I previously took the CodeSignal GCA and scored below 650.**
       No worries! Study up and retake the [assessment](https://app.codesignal.com/get-certified?invite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) if it has been longer than 2 weeks.
     - **I've taken the CodeSignal GCA and scored 650+.**
       Great! T[ake it again](https://app.codesignal.com/get-certified?invite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) as a higher score can open doors to more opportunities. Some partners/companies have higher score requirements. Regardless, as long as your student profile is complete, and your score has been reported to Lambda, you’ll have access to hiring partner opportunities via Job Board.
     - **I don’t want to take CodeSignal GCA.**
       You don’t have to! Work with your careers staff member to find external opportunities. Hiring partner opportunities are meant to supplement graduates’ job search. There are many opportunities out there that don’t require a GCA score.
     - **I'm an alumni. Do I need to take it?**
       If you would like access to hiring partners, yes! Make sure we have a score on file for you. You will also need to notify a Job Search or Careers staff member know you're a job seeking alumni. Feel free to reach out to @Nilza Santana-Castillo
     - **I don't remember my score. How do I see my score?**
       When you complete assessments with CodeSignal you receive an email with a link to view scores via the CodeSignal site. Still having difficulty finding it? Ping a careers staff member.
       As long as you used Lambda's assessment link and your student email, your score will be forwarded.

## How do I apply for a partner opportunity?

- All partner opportunities will come in through [Job Tracker](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/jobtracker), along with a Slack notification.
- State specifically WHY you're interested in the opportunity and select the "Yes, I'm Interested" button.
- The job card will stay in your Job Tracker and automatically move to the _Applied_ or _Not Moving Forward_ column based on what happens when we send your information to the partner.
- NOTE: please make sure you read the opportunity and ensure it fits your abilities and location preferences before applying. If it isn't a fit, there will be plenty more. Please don't just opt into every opportunity without reading through the opportunity first.

## **What happens after I opt into a partnership opportunity?**

- Within 2 weeks, we'll send your resume and LinkedIn to the hiring partner (unless another timeline is specified in the posting).
- The hiring partner will go through all candidates and reach out to you via email if they'd like to move forward.
- If you are moving forward, you'll hear directly from the company via email.
- This process can take 4-6 weeks before hearing back, so please be patient.
