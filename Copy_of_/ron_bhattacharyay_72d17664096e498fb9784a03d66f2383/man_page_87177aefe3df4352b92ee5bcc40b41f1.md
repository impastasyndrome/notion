I live in San Francisco and I [sail often](http://sailoften.com).

Besides run-on sentences, I enjoy fiddling with guitars, [running berries](https://killerqueenarcade.com/), cooking poorly, finding my [tempo](http://tempo.fit), hoarding as much [wheat as possible](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alex/papers/cig2014_gs.pdf), struggling to make people laugh, choosing between [350s and 4s](omnibus%20d23dd80eab1c457c9e84a1495ecc83e1/Untitled%20Database%2051e7daba360e4051921ca0f93695cad1.csv) in the morning, and laughing at horrendously written television (think [White Collar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/)).

I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with Statistics at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/). I've written code and designed hardware at [Zenreach](http://zenreach.com/), [Google](http://google.com/), [NetApp](http://netapp.com/), and [Boeing](http://boeing.com/). I formerly led the world champion [Bay Orangutans](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5499/history), built [StartupSift](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/startupsift), organized [Cal Hacks](http://calhacks.io/), and ran [Hackers at Berkeley](https://hackersatberkeley.com/).

[Reach out](https://t.me/aranibatta) if there’s any chance I can be helpful.
