# Can you show me an example where you defined unique routes for API resources? Why was it necessary to build your API this way?

1: Explanation includes only one route (either combines server and client, or only discusses one option).

Explanation focuses on project requirements, does not actually explain the importance of routing.

Student cannot score higher than a one if they misuse or incorrectly explain request and response methods.
2: Student built and deployed a Web API following the REST architectural pattern with code that is clean and organized using the Express Framework.

Explanation must include differentiation between client and server route and why different routes are needed (specificity, readability)

Student may include details about naming with nouns, http verb usage, resource hierarchy, etc.

3: Student's explanation includes variable scoping such that API could be dynamically deployed to any website.

Student incorporated services interfaces and appropriate repositories for code reuse and deployed the API to a hosting platform.

The API is configured to dynamically load configuration and secrets using environment variables

Objective: Use Express' built-in router to build and test a modular server API with Postman.
