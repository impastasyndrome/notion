🎉 Your cold contact responded to your request, and is open to a quick phone call!

### Now what?

First, congratulate yourself on a job well done! You've advocated for yourself and given yourself a chance to become more than a resume to your potential new team. 🤸🏻‍♂️ **Well done!** 🤸🏻‍♂️

### You have two goals with your informational interviews:

- ⭐ **Goal #1 is to make a new friend, simple as that!**
    <aside>
    📌 This is your primary goal. People won't refer people they don't like!

    Remember that people love to talk about themselves and, most importantly, love people that [invite them to talk about themselves](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/positive-prescription/201703/why-we-love-talking-about-ourselves)!
    
    - ❓**Sample questions to get people talking in an information interview**
        - How did you first get started with {company name}?
        - I've noticed that Bloom is growing like crazy right now! How do you keep up with all that new traffic while still considering legacy customers and features?
        - What is a typical "day in the life" for you? What do you do everyday, without fail?
        - What were you well prepared for when joining this company or team? What were you underprepared for?
        - What makes a great {role you are applying for} on your team? What is really important to you in your next hire or next teammate?
        - How does your team celebrate wins?

- ⭐ **Goal #2 is to drive the conversation to your interest in the company.**
  Before hopping off the call, make sure to ask these important questions, which work to drive the conversation towards internal referrals.
    <aside>
    🗣️  **I recently applied to the open `Role Title` at `Company Name` and am even more excited about the potential of working at the company after chatting with you, which I didn't think was possible. How would you recommend I stand out in the application process?**
    
    </aside>
    
    - If this doesn't yield a lot of movement — i.e. you get more of a *"study up on code challenges"* answer than *"let me check in with my boss for you!"* move on to this ⤵️
    
    <aside>
    🗣️ **Is there anyone else you would recommend I talk with at the company who is involved in hiring for this role?**
    
    </aside>
    
    - *If you get a name from this person, see if they are open to making the connection for you. "Thank you so much for that name! Are you able to connect the two of us?"*
    
    If you don't get much from either question, never fear! An informational interview is never a waste of time. You've just met a new contact in the tech field (and made a new friend!). Tech hiring is very network- based. If this person gets contacted by a recruiter in the future or sees another role in their network, it is very possible they'll think of you for it. This is another reason to make sure you set a 📅 reminder to follow up with them in the future! 


### If you do just one thing make sure you ask this question

### Post informational interview

Send a thank you letter that same day!

- ✉️ **Sample Thank you**
  **SUBJECT: Thank you for your time today!**
  \*\*Hi (name),
  Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today to talk about your experience at {company name}. After learning more about (share one or two takeaways from the interview about the company/team’s priorities), I’m even more excited about the team and the problems you are solving! _{Optional note about something you chatted about/inside joke/article that relates, etc.}_
  I really appreciate you offering to touch base with your boss about me and my resume — if there is anything that I can clarify about my experience or qualifications, please don’t hesitate to reach out!
  Thank you for your consideration,
  (your name)\*\*

No matter what comes of the talk, make **a calendar 📅 reminder** to follow up with this person in the next **1 - 2 months**. Consider sending them an article about something related to your conversation or a quick snapshot of a project you are working on.

- See if they need any support on anything, as appreciation for them taking time to chat with you a few months ago.
- Keeping connections alive is as important as making new ones. You never know what being top of mind can do for you in the future!
