### Random Things to Remember

**[A list of all of my articles to link to future posts\***You should probably skip this one… seriously it’s just for internal use!\*bryanguner.medium.com](https://bryanguner.medium.com/a-list-of-all-of-my-articles-to-link-to-future-posts-1f6f88ebdf5b)

### Using `()` implicitly returns components.Role of `index.js` is to _render_ your application.The reference to `root` comes from a div in the body of your public html file.State of a component is simply a regular JS Object.Class Components require `render()` method to return JSX.Functional Components directly return JSX.`Class` is `className` in React.When parsing for an integer just chain `Number.parseInt("123")`

- **Use ternary operator if you want to make a conditional inside a fragment.**

```
{ x === y ? <div>Naisu</div> : <div>Not Naisu</div>; }
```

```
Purpose of React.Fragment is to allow you to create groups of children without adding an extra dom element.
```

- **React** manages the creation and updating of DOM nodes in your Web page.
- All it does is dynamically render stuff into your DOM.
- What it doesn’t do:
- Ajax
- Services
- Local Storage
- Provide a CSS framework
- **React** is unopinionated
- Just contains a few rules for developers to follow, and it just works.
- **JSX** : Javascript Extension is a language invented to help write React Applications (looks like a mixture of JS and HTML)
- Here is an overview of the difference between rendering out vanilla JS to create elements, and JSX:
- This may seem like a lot of code but when you end up building many components, it becomes nice to put each of those functions/classes into their own files to organize your code.**Using tools with React**
- `React DevTools` : New tool in your browser to see ow React is working in the browser
- `create-react-app` : Extensible command-line tool to help generate standard React applications.
- `Webpack` : In between tool for dealing with the extra build step involved.

- **HMR** : (Hot Module Replacement) When you make changes to your source code the changes are delivered in real-time.
- React Developers created something called `Flux Architecture` to moderate how their web page consumes and modifies data received from back-end API's.

- **Choosing React**
- Basically, React is super important to learn and master.

### React Concepts and Features

There are many benefits to using React over just Vanilla JS.

- `Modularity`
- To avoid the mess of many event listeners and template strings, React gives you the benefit of a lot of modularity.
- `Easy to start`
- No specials tools are needed to use Basic React.
- You can start working directly with `createElement` method in React.
- `Declarative Programming`
- React is declarative in nature, utilizing either it’s build in createElement method or the higher-level language known as JSX.
- `Reusability`
- Create elements that can be re-used over and over.**One-flow of data**
- React apps are built as a combination of parent and child components.
- Parents can have one or more child components, all children have parents.
- Data is never passed from child to the parent.
- `Virtual DOM` : React provides a Virtual DOM that acts as an agent between the real DOM and the developer to help debug, maintain, and provide general use.
- Due to this usage, React handles web pages much more intelligently; making it one of the speediest Front End Libraries available.
