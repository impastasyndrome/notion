### How To Implement Native(ES6) Data Structures Using Arrays & Objects

### _Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is_

### _defined by a set of value and a set of operations. The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented._

> Abstract Data Type(ADT) is a data type, where only behavior is defined but not implementation.

> Opposite of ADT is Concrete Data Type (CDT), where it contains an implementation of ADT.

> Examples:Array, List, Map, Queue, Set, Stack, Table, Tree, and Vector are ADTs. Each of these ADTs has many implementations i.e. CDT. The container is a high-level ADT of above all ADTs.

> Real life example:
> book is Abstract (Telephone Book is an implementation)

[Abstract data types, commonly abbreviated ADTs, are a way of classifying data structures based on how they are used and the behaviors they provide.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65771454/15158587) They do not specify how the data structure must be implemented or laid out in memory, but simply provide a minimal expected interface and set of behaviors. For example, a stack is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure with LIFO (last in, first out) behavior. Stacks are commonly implemented using arrays or linked lists, but a needlessly complicated implementation using a binary search tree is still a valid implementation. To be clear, it is incorrect to say that stacks are arrays or vice versa. An array can be used as a stack. Likewise, a stack can be implemented using an array.

Since abstract data types don’t specify an implementation, this means it’s also incorrect to talk about the time complexity of a given abstract data type. An associative array may or may not have O(1) average search times. An associative array that is implemented by a hash table does have O(1) average search times.
