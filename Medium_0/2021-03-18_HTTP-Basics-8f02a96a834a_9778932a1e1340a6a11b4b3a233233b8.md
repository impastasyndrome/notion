### HTTP Basics

> “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men and women to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” — Antoine de Saint-Exupery;

- `HTTP` : Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- `HT` : Hypertext - content with references to other content.
- Term used to refer to content in computing.
- What makes the Web a “web”.
- Most fundamental part of how we interact.
- `Hyperlinks` : Links; references between HT resources.
- `TP` : Transfer Protocol - set of guidelines surrounding the transmission of data.
- Defines the expectations for both ends of the transer.
- Defines some ways the transfer might fail.
- HTTP is a `request/response` protocol.
- HTTP works between `clients` & `servers`.
- `Clients` : User Agent - the data consumer.
- `Servers` : Origin - Data provider & where the application is running.

### [Components of HTTP-based systems](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#components_of_http-based_systems)

HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.

Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer, called the _response_. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called [proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server), which perform different operations and act as gateways or [caches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache), for example.

**Properties of HTTP**

- `Reliable Connections` : Messages passed between a client & server sacrifice a little speed for the sake of trust.
- `TCP` is HTTP’s preferred connection type.
- `Stateless Transfer` : HTTP is a stateless protocol - meaning it does not store any kind of information.
- HTTP supports cookies.
- `Intermediaries` : Servers or devices that pass your request along which come in three types:

1. `Proxies` : Modify your request so it appears to come from a different source.
2. `Gateways` : Pretend to be the resource server you requested.
3. `Tunnels` : Simply passes your request along.

### HTTP Requests

**Structure of an HTTP Request**

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: appacademy.io
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/76.0.3809.132 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
```

### Example of a request:

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*tq-BRYuzZ_Dx8s1g5xJKKQ.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*tq-BRYuzZ_Dx8s1g5xJKKQ.png)

- **Request-line & HTTP verbs**
- The first line of an HTTP Request made up of three parts:

1. The `Method` : Indicated by an HTTP Verb.
2. The `URI` : Uniform Resource Indicator that ID’s our request.
3. THe `HTTP` **Version** : Version we expect to use.

- HTTP Verbs are a simply way of declaring our intention to the server.
- `GET` : Used for direct requests.
- `POST`: Used for creating new resources on the server.
- `PUT`: Used to updated a resource on the server.
- `PATCH` : Similar to PUT, but do not require the whole resource to perform the update.
- `DELETE` : Used to destroy resources on the server.

**Headers**

- Key-Value pairs that come after the request line — they appear on sep. lines and define metadata needed to process the request.
- Some common headers:
- `Host` : Root path for our URI.
- `User-Agent` : Displays information about which browser the request originated from.
- `Referer` : Defines the URL you’re coming from.
- `Accept` : Indicates what the client will receive.
- `Content`\*\*\*\* : Define Details about the body of the request.

**Body**

- For when we need to send data that doesn’t fit into the header & is too complex for the URI we can use the _body_.
- `URL encoding` : Most common way form data is formatted.
- `name=claire&age=29&iceCream=vanilla`
- We can also format using JSON or XML.

**Sending an HTTP request from the command line**

- **netcat** : (nc) A Utility that comes as part of Unix-line environments such as Ubuntu and macOS.
- Allows us to open a direct connection with a URL and manually send HTTP requests.
- `nc -v appacademy.io 80`
- `man nc` to open the netcat manual.

### HTTP Responses

**Structure of a Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: close
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
Set-Cookie: _rails-class-site_session=BAh7CEkiD3Nlc3Npb25faWQGOgZFVEkiJTM5NWM5YTVlNTEyZDFmNTNlN; path=/; secure; HttpOnly
X-Request-Id: cf5f30dd-99d0-46d7-86d7-6fe57753b20d
X-Runtime: 0.006894
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
Vary: Origin
Via: 1.1 vegur
Expect-CT: max-age=604800, report-uri="https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct"
Server: cloudflare
CF-RAY: 51d641d1ca7d2d45-TXL
```

```

```

**Status**

- First line of an HTTP response — gives us a high level overview of the server’s intentions. (`status line`)
- `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
- `HTTP status codes` : numeric way of representing a server’s response.
- Follow the structure: x: xxx — xxx;

### `Status codes 100 - 199: Informational`

- Allow the clinet to know that a req. was received, and provides extra info from the server.

### `Status codes 200 - 299: Successful`

- Indicate that the request has succeeded and the server is handling it.
- Common Examples: 200 OK (req received and fulfilled) & 201 Created (received and new record was created)

### `Status codes 300 - 399: Redirection`

- Let the client know if there has been a change.
- Common Examples: 301 Moved Permanently (resource you requested is in a totally new location) & 302 Found (indicates a temporary move)

### `Status codes 400 - 499: Client Error`

- Indicate problem with client’s request.
- Common Examples: 400 Bad Request (received, but could not understand) & 401 Unauthorized (resource exists but you’re not allowed to see w/o authentication) & 403 Forbidden (resource exists but you’re not allowed to see it at all ) & 404 Not Found (resource requested does not exist);

### `Status codes 500 - 599: Server Error`

- Indicates request was formatted correctly, but the server couldn’t do what you asked due to an internal problem.
- Common Examples: 500 Internal Server Error (Server had trouble processing) & 504 Gateway Timeout (Server timeout);

### **Headers** : Work just like HTTP requests.

> Common Examples:

- `Location` : Used by client for redirection responses.
- `Content-Type` : Let’s client know what format the body is in.
- `Expires` : When response is no longer valid
- `Content-Disposition` : Let’s client know how to display the response.
- `Set-Cookie` : Sends data back to the client to set on the cookie.
- `Data` : If the request is successful, the body of the response will contain the resource you have requested.
