**The Best Cloud-Based Code Playgrounds of 2021 (Part 1)
A plethora of front-end code playgrounds have appeared over the years. They offer a convenient way to experiment with client-side code and teach/share with others without the hassle of configuring a development environment.**

### Typical features of these online playgrounds include:

- **_color-coded HTML, CSS and JavaScript editors_**
- **_a preview window — many update on the fly without a refresh_**
- **_HTML pre-processors such as HAML_**
- **_LESS, SASS and Stylus CSS pre-processing_**
- **_inclusion of popular JavaScript libraries_**
- **_developer consoles and code validation tools_**
- **_sharing via a short URL_**
- **_embedding demonstrations in other pages_**
- **_code forking_**
- **_zero cost (or payment for premium services only)_**
- **_showing off your coding skills to the world!_**

---

**The following list is in no particular order and which playground you use is a matter of application and personal taste, they each have their own specialities.**

---

### 1.) REPL.IT

### My personal favorite for it’s simplicity, versatility and capabilities.

### ⚫No downloads, no configs, no setups

In your browser. Repl.it runs fully in your browser, so you can get started coding in seconds. No more ZIPs, PKGs, DMGs and WTFs.

> Any OS, any device(I’m looking at you chromebook coders). You can use Repl.it on macOS, Windows, Linux, or any other OS .

### ⚫Clone, commit and push to any GitHub repo.

Repl from Repo. Get started with any Github repo, right from your browser. Commit and push without touching your terminal.

### ⚫[Markdown Preview](https://blog.replit.com/markdown-preview)

**>A new but fundamentally important feature**

### ⚫[No-setup Unit Testing](https://blog.replit.com/unit-tests)

**>Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development & learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. Repl.it now features zero-setup unit testing!**

### ⚫[HTTPS by default](https://blog.replit.com/https)

### In the example below I have 72 solved Javascript Leetcode Problems but REPL.IT can handle almost any language you can think of.

**Here’s another one that contains the Repl.it Docs:**

### JS-Fiddle

> jsFiddle is a cloud-based JavaScript code playground that allows web developers to tweak their code and see the results of this tweaking in real time. The editor supports not only JavaScript and its variants but also HTML and CSS code, and it further supports popular JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery, AngularJS, ReactiveJS and D3. The ad-supported site is also completely free to use.

### ⚫Entering and running code

> JSFiddle has the notion of panels (or tabs if you switch into the tabbed layout), there are 4 panels, 3 where you can enter code, and 1 to see the result.

- **HTML** — structure code, no need to add `body` `doctype` `head`, that's added automatically
- **CSS** — styles. You can switch pre-pocessor to SCSS
- **JavaScript** — behavior. There are many frameworks and code pre-processors you can use

Once you enter code, just hit **Run** in the top actions bar, and the fourth panel with results will appear.

### ⚫Saving and Forking code

- **Save** / **Update** will do what you think, it’ll save a new fiddle or update an existing one (and add a version number to it)
- **Fork** will split out an existing fiddle into a new one, starting with version 0

---

### StackBlitz

[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/)

- **Installs packages ≥5x faster than Yarn & NPM 🔥**
- **Reduces the size of** `node_modules` **up to two orders of magnitude 😮**
- **Has multiple layers of redundancy for production grade reliability** 💪
- **Works _entirely_ within your web browser, enabling lightning fast dev environments ⚡️**

> Dependencies still slip into the install process as dev & sub-dependencies and are downloaded & extracted all the same, resulting in the infamous black hole known as node_modules:

**Dank, relevant meme (pictured Left)**

**This is the crux of what prevents NPM from working natively in-browser. Resolving, downloading, and extracting the hundreds of megabytes (or gigabytes) typical frontend projects contain in their** `node_modules` **folder is a challenge browsers just aren’t well suited for. Additionally, this is also why existing server side solutions to this problem have proven to be** **[slow, unreliable](https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg/issues/35#issuecomment-317128917)**

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sl4vb3fP9-MErkioiCOyKQ.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sl4vb3fP9-MErkioiCOyKQ.png)

### Then just paste the embed code in an iframe and you’re good to go!

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PjhrjtInF1dPudtO.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PjhrjtInF1dPudtO.png)

> On StackBlitz.com, you can create new projects and get the embed code from the ‘Share’ dropdown link in the top navigation like so:

### Embed Options

> <iframe src=”https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular?embed=1"></iframe>

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6QF4ywBOMVFtS_MukRkLKw.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6QF4ywBOMVFtS_MukRkLKw.png)

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5ekSGpNwJ28hI9Aog8V4DQ.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5ekSGpNwJ28hI9Aog8V4DQ.png)

> 🡩 Alternatively, you can also use StackBlitz’s Javascript SDK methods for easily embedding StackBlitz projects on the page & avoid all the hassles of creating/configuring iframes.

H**ere’s a sample project of mine, it’s a medium clone… _(So Metta)_… feel free to write a post… or don’t …but either way … as you can see… Stack Blitz enables you to write serious web applications in a fraction of the time it would take with a conventional setup.**

### Glitch

### ⚫**_[Glitch](https://glitch.com/)_** **provides two project templates that you can use to start creating your app:**

1. **Classic Website**
2. **Node.js**

If you know the type of project that you would like to create, [click here to get started!](https://glitch.com/create-project) Or keep reading to learn more about the Classic Website and Node.js templates.

### ⚫**Classic Website**

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AMVRXebQBuww_n_P.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AMVRXebQBuww_n_P.png)

The **Classic Website** template is your starting point for creating a **static** website that includes an index.html page and static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Just start typing and your work will be live on the internet! Static websites enjoy unlimited uptime too! This means that your website stays on 24/7 without using your [Project Hours](https://glitch.happyfox.com/kb/article/17/#Uptime).

An existing project will be identified by Glitch as a **static** site if it does not contain one of the following files:

- **package.json**
- **requirements.txt**
- **glitch.json**

### ⚫**Node.js**

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ppgGuMTHg-YxnImp.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ppgGuMTHg-YxnImp.png)

If you are looking to build a full-stack JavaScript application, choose the **Node.js** template. This template includes both front-end and back-end code using the popular [Express](https://expressjs.com/) Node.js application framework.

### ⚫**Here are some other ways to get started on Glitch…**

- Create an app by [importing a GitHub repo](https://glitch.happyfox.com/kb/article/20-can-i-import-code-from-a-github-repository/).
- Build an app that integrates with a popular third-party platform or framework, by remixing [one of these starter templates](https://glitch.com/create).
