# Objects In JavaScript

The object is a data structure that stores other data, similar to how an array stores elements.

### Objects In JavaScript

### The `object` is a data structure that stores other data, similar to how an array stores elements.

- The object differs in that each `value` stores in an obj is associated with a `key`.

### **The Object**

In other programming languages, objects are referred to as, “dictionaries”, “maps”, or “associative arrays”.

- Objects are indexed with `keys` instead of numbers.
- Order is not guaranteed within an Object.
- Objects are defined by using curly braces `{}`
- You can think of Objects as tables.

### **Setting Keys and Values**

```
// here "color" is the key!
>
car["color"] = "Blue";
"Blue"
```

```
>
car["seats"] = 2;
2
```

```
    // accessing our object at the key of color
    >
    car["color"]
"Blue"
```

```
>
car["seats"]
2
```

```
    >
    car {
        color: "Blue",
        seats: 2
    }
```

- We assign values to an object by defining the name of the key in brackets and assigning it to a value.

```
> car {
    color: "Blue",
    seats: 2
}
```

```
>
"color" in car;
true
```

```
    >
    "model" in car;
false
```

- If we try to access a key that has not yet been assigned within an object we will output undefined.
- The **preferred method** for checking to see if an object exists at a key is to use the `in` operator.

### **Using Variables as Keys**

```
> car {
    color: "Blue",
    seats: 2
}
```

```
>
let newVariable = "color";
undefined
```

```
    >
    newVariable "color"
```

```
    >
    car[newVariable]
"Blue"
```

```
-- -
```

```
>
car {
    color: "Blue",
    seats: 2
}
```

```
>
newVariable
    "weight"
```

```
    // assigning a key value pair using a variable!
    >
    car[newVariable] = 1000;
1000
```

```
    >
    car {
        color: "Blue",
        seats: 2,
        weight: 1000
    }
```

- It is useful to set a variable as a key because variables can be re-assigned new values — this way we can quickly access different data and also create new key/value pairs.

### Using Different Notations

```
>
let dog = {};
undefined
```

```
    >
    dog.bark = "Bowowowo";
"Bowowowowo"
```

```
>
dog.bark "Bowowowo"
```

```
    >
    dog {
        bark: "Bowowowowo"
    }
```

- We can also use **dot notation** **“.”** to access key/value pairs in an object.
- One thing to note is that when using dot notation, we do not have to use string quotes as the key.

### **Bracket Notation vs Dot Notation**

**DotBracket**Easier To ReadYou can use variables as keys! Easier To Write b/c do not need Quotations. Okay to use variables and Strings that start with numbers.Cannot access with VariablesKeys cannot contain numbers as their first character

- **When accessing object keys**: Bracket notation needs to refer to that key in quotations, dot notation doesn’t.
- **When accessing object keys via a variable**: Bracket notation can refer to that key w/o use of quotations, dot notation can’t do this at all.

```
let myDog = {};
myDog.name = "Fido";
```

```
let myKey = "name";
console.log(myDog); // prints `{name: "Fido"}`
console.log(myDog[myKey]); // prints `Fido`
```

```
console.log(myDog.myKey); // prints: undefined
```

- As illustrated above, the dot notation cannot access a variable key — since it takes a **literal** interpretation of the key.

You can put an object together in a single statement.

```
let myDog = {
    name: "Fido",
    type: "Doge",
    age: 2,
    favoriteToys: ["bone", "ball"],
};
```

### **Operator Precedence Revisited**

- The concept of Operator Precedence also applies to objects.
- There are two types of associativity:
- `Right Associativity` : When code is evaluated right to left.

```
a = b = 1;
```

```
- Since **assignment of variables** takes lowest precendence, we end up evaluating b = 1 first before a = b.
```

- `Left Associativity` : When code is evaluated left to right.

```
let id = "header";
    let element = document.getElementById(id).value;
```

```
- We first resolve the document variable, then use dot notation to retrive the getElementById function, we eval it's arguments, access it's value, and then retrieve assignment \(the lowest precedence\).
```

### Iterating Through Objects

Because objects store **unordered** key-value pairs, we do not rely on indices to access values; instead, we rely on our keys.

### **A New Kind of For Loop**

```
for (let variable in object) {
    statement;
```

```
    let obj = {
        name: "Rose",
        cats: 2
    };
    for (let currentKey in obj) {
        console.log(currentKey);
        console.log(obj[currentKey]);
    }
```

```
    // prints out:
    // name
    // cats
    // Rose
    // 2
}
```

- We use a special syntax to iterate through each key of an object called a `for-in loop`.

### **Methods vs Functions**

A `Method` is a function that belongs to an object. Every method is a function, but not every function is a method.

```
myFunc is a
function
myObject.myFunc is a method of the object myObject
myObject["myFunc"] is a method of the object myObject
```

- **Methods** are just a key-value pair where the **key is the function name and the value is the function definition**.

```
let dog = {
    name: "Fido",
};
```

```
dog.bark = function() {
    console.log("bark bark!");
};
```

```
// this is the same thing as above just using Bracket Notation
dog["speak"] = function(string) {
    console.log("WOOF " + string + " WOOF!!!");
};
```

```
dog.bark(); // prints `bark bark!`
dog.speak("pizza"); // prints `WOOF pizza WOOF!!!`
```

```
let dog2 = {
    name: "Rover",
```

```
    bark: function() {
        console.log("bork bork!");
    },
```

```
    speak: function(string) {
        console.log("BORK " + string + " BORK!!!");
    },
};
// Notice that in the object above, we still separate the key-value pairs with commas.
// `bark` and `speak` are just keys with functions as values.
```

```
dog2.bark(); // prints `bork bork!`
dog2.speak("burrito"); // prints `BORK burrito BORK!!!`
```

- To invoke these methods we just need to specify which object is calling that method.

```
myObject.methodName();
```

### **Useful Object Methods**

- `Object.keys()` : A method that allows us to iterate through keys, it accepts an obj as the argument and returns an array of the keys.
- `Object.values()` : Method that accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the values.

### **Iterating through an Object’s keys & values**

- `Object.entries` : Method that accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the [key, value] pairs within.

```
> Object.entries(cat)[['name', 'Freyja'], ['color', 'orange']]
```

### References vs Primitives

### **Primitives vs Objects**

So far we have learned about 6 different data types:

- **Primitive**: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String.
- **Reference**: Object (Arrays are a type of object)
- Remember that **primitive** types are immutable!

### **Immutability**

- When we reassign primitives we simply have our variable point elsewhere in memory.
- In a nutshell, **immutability** cannot change values in memory, but only reassign where our variables are pointing to.

### **Mutability**

- If we change either cat1 or cat2, our computer memory will change because they are both pointing at the same memory location.

### Rest and Spread

### **Using the Spread Operator and Rest Parameter Syntax** **Accepting Arguments**

- Just keep in mind that the function will still run even if it is not passed any arguments.
- Parameters will take just as many arguments as they need even if more than enough is offered.
- We will encounter an error if there are not enough parameters ( > 0).

### **Utilizing Rest Parameters**

- `Rest Parameter Syntax` : Allows us to capture all of a function's incoming arguments into an array.
- Only the last parameter can be a rest parameter.

### **Utilizing Spread Syntax**

- **Spread Operator**: This allows us to break down a data type into the elements that make it up.
- Takes a data type (i.e. array, obj) and spreads the values of that type where elements are expected.
- Takes iterable data and spreads the elements of that type where arguments are expected.

```
let numArray = [1, 2, 3];
```

```
// here we are taking `numArray` and *spreading* it into a new array where
// comma separated elements are expected to be
let moreNums = [...numArray, 4, 5, 6];
```

```
>
moreNums
// => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

**With Objects**

```
let colors = {
    red: "scarlet",
    blue: "aquamarine"
};
let newColors = {
    ...colors
};
```

```
>
newColors
// { red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine" };
```

```
let colors = {
    red: "scarlet",
    blue: "aquamarine"
};
let colors2 = {
    green: "forest",
    yellow: "sunflower"
};
```

```
let moreColors = {
    ...colors,
    ...colors2
};
```

```
>
moreColors
// {red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine", green: "forest", yellow: "sunflo
```
