### Python:

- Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose, dynamically typed programming language
- It is also Object oriented, modular oriented and a scripting language.
- In Python, everything is considered as an Object.
- A python file has an extension of .py
- Python follows Indentation to separate code blocks instead of flower brackets({}).
- We can run a python file by the following command in cmd(Windows) or shell(mac/linux).
- `python <filename.py>`

### By default, the python doesn’t require any imports to run a python file.

### Create and execute a program

1. Open up a terminal/cmd
2. Create the program: nano/cat > [nameProgram.py](http://nameprogram.py/)
3. Write the program and save it
4. python [nameProgram.py](http://nameprogram.py/)

### Basic Datatypes

### Keywords

### Operators

![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G4pUq67UDWJSZsULGe7j2g.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G4pUq67UDWJSZsULGe7j2g.png)

### Basic Data Structures

### List

- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Lists are created using square brackets:

```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
- List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
- The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
- To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function.
- A list can contain different data types:

```
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
```

- It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list

```
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets
```

### Tuple

- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
- Tuples are written with round brackets.

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

- Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
- Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
- When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
- Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:
- Tuples allow duplicate values:

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
```

- To determine how many items a tuple has, use the `len()`function:

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))
```

- To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

```
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))
```

```
#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))
```

- It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.

```
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)
```

### Set

- Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

- Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
- Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
- Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
- Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
- Duplicate values will be ignored.
- To determine how many items a set has, use the `len()` method.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

```
print(len(thisset))
```

- Set items can be of any data type:

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
set3 = {True, False, False}
set4 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}
```

- It is also possible to use the `set()` constructor to make a set.

```
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
```

### Dictionary

- Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
- Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
```

- Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])
```

- Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
- Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.
- Duplicate values will overwrite existing values.
- To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the `len()` function.

```
print(len(thisdict))
```

- The values in dictionary items can be of any data type

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
```

### Conditional branching

```
if condition:
        pass
    elif condition2:
        pass
    else:
        pass
```

### Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

1. while loops
2. for loops

### While loop

- With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
- Example: Print i as long as i is less than 6

```
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

- The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
- With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
- With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.
- With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

### For loop

- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
- This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
- With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```

- The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
- To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function.
- The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
- The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3).
- The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished.
  A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.
- The “inner loop” will be executed one time for each iteration of the “outer loop”:

```
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

```
for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
```

- for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

```
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
```

### Function definition

```
def function_name():
    return
```

### Function call

```
function_name()
```

- We need not to specify the return type of the function.
- Functions by default return `None`
- We can return any datatype.
