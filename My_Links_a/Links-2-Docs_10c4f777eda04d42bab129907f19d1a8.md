## Branches and deploys

Netlify lets you control which branches in your Git repository you want to deploy.

### Definitions

- **Production branch**: the Git branch that Netlify uses to build and deploy changes to your site’s main URL. For example, `www.yourcustomdomain.com` and `yoursitename.netlify.app`.
- **Production deploy**: a deploy from the production branch. If auto publishing is enabled, each new production deploy will update what is published at your site’s main URL.
- **Branch deploy**: a deploy generated from a branch that is not your production branch. Branch deploys are published to a URL which includes the branch name as a prefix. For example, if a branch is called `staging`, it will deploy to `staging--yoursitename.netlify.app`. If you use Netlify DNS, you can enable branch subdomains, so the `staging` branch example would deploy to `staging.yourcustomdomain.com`.
- **Deploy Preview**: a deploy generated from a pull request or merge request, building the site as it would be if the proposed changes were merged. Deploy Previews are published to a URL which has the prefix `deploy-preview` followed by the identifier number of the pull request or merge request. For example, a Deploy Preview for pull/merge request #42 will deploy to `deploy-preview-42--yoursitename.netlify.app`. For more information, visit the docs on [Deploy Previews](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/).
- **Permalink**: every successful build of your site also creates a deploy permalink that starts with the deploy ID number. For example: `1234abcd12acde000111cdef--yoursitename.netlify.app`. The web content at this URL never changes. This is in contrast to production deploys, branch deploys, and Deploy Previews where the web content is updated when you merge or push new commits.

### Branch deploy controls

By default, Netlify deploys the site’s production branch after every change.

To generate branch deploys for other branches in your repository, select your site on the **Sites** page. Then go to **Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment > Branches**, and select **Edit settings**. You can choose to deploy all branches (including future branches), or select individual branches you would like to deploy.

![Links-2-Docs%2010c4f777eda04d42bab129907f19d1a8/site-deploys-allowed_branches.png](Links-2-Docs%2010c4f777eda04d42bab129907f19d1a8/site-deploys-allowed_branches.png)

When selecting individual branches for deployment, type the name of each branch you want to deploy. You can also enter branch names you haven’t created yet.

Once you select some or all of your branches for branch deploys, Netlify will start watching those branches for new commits and pull/merge requests. As soon as you start pushing changes to those branches, you’ll find new deploys for those branches.

### Deploy Preview controls

By default, Netlify automatically builds Deploy Previews for GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests when the base/target branch is your production branch. If you enable branch deploys for some or all of your other branches, we’ll also build Deploy Previews for pull/merge requests against those branches. The [Netlify Drawer](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/) is enabled by default for Deploy Previews.

You can control in the UI whether or not Deploy Previews are generated for pull/merge requests. You can also enable or disable the Netlify Drawer. To change these settings, select your site and go to **Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment > Deploy Previews**, then select **Edit settings**.

### Search engine indexing

Netlify automatically ensures that only your currently published production deploy and most recent branch deploys can be indexed by search engines. Requests to Deploy Previews, unpublished production deploys, and old branch deploys will have an `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header included in the response. Depending on how you use branch deploys, you may want to prevent even your most recent branch deploys from being indexed by search engines. You can do so by configuring [custom headers](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/) in your branch.

## Deploy contexts

Deploy contexts give you the flexibility to [configure your site’s builds](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration) depending on the context they are going to be deployed to.

There are three predefined deploy contexts:

- `production`: this context corresponds to the main site’s deployment, attached to the Git branch you set when the site is created.
- `deploy-preview`: this context corresponds to the previews we build for pull/merge requests.
- `branch-deploy`: this context corresponds to deploys from branches that are not the site’s main production branch.

Besides these three predefined contexts, sites can use also branch names as custom deploy contexts. For example, a branch called `staging` will match a deploy context called `staging`.

Deploy contexts allow you to override options from your site’s settings including the build command, the environment variables added to the build, [Build Plugin configuration](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/), and more.

Overrides are applied in a hierarchical order. The site’s global settings apply to each deploy, if we’re building the production site, and if you change options in your production context, they will be overridden. Only options that are set explicitly are overridden; if you leave one out, the build will use the value of the global settings or previous contexts. Environment variables are also overridden individually, for example, you can have access tokens as environment variables per context.

To configure deploy contexts, you must create a file called `netlify.toml` in the root of your Git repository. There, you can set as many contexts as you want to configure.

```
# Production context:
# All deploys from the main repository branch
# will inherit these settings.
[context.production]
  command = "make production"
  [context.production.environment]
    ACCESS_TOKEN = "super secret"
  # Deploys from main branch run this plugin in the build.
  # Plugins context requires double brackets.
  [[context.production.plugins]]
    package = "@netlify/plugin-sitemap"

# Deploy Preview context:
# All deploys generated from a pull/merge request
# will inherit these settings.
[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  ACCESS_TOKEN = "not so secret"

# Branch deploy context:
# All deploys that are not from a pull/merge request
# or from the production branch will inherit these settings.
[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "make staging"

# Specific branch context:
# Deploys from this branch will take these settings
# and override their current ones.
[context.feature]
  command = "make feature"

[context."features/branch"]
  command = "gulp"

```

File-based configuration settings will override those set in the UI. In the `netlify.toml` file, settings for more specific contexts will override more general ones. For example, settings for a specific branch will override those for branch-deploy.

Visit our docs on [file-based configuration](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration) to learn more about what you can do with deploy contexts.
