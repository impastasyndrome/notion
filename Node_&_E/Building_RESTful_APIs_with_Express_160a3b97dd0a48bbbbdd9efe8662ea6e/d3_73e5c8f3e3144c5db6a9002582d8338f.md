# Objective 1 - explain the role of a foreign key

## **Overview**

**Foreign keys** are a type of table field used for creating links between tables. Like **primary keys**, they are most often integers that identify (rather than store) data. However, whereas a primary key is used to id rows in a table, foreign keys are used to connect a record in one table to a record in a second table.

## **Follow Along**

Consider the following `farms` and `ranchers` tables.

[Untitled](d3%2073e5c8f3e3144c5db6a9002582d8338f/Untitled%20Database%20b88ebcd8fa3a4fa3a36cf99c939f6067.csv)

[Untitled](d3%2073e5c8f3e3144c5db6a9002582d8338f/Untitled%20Database%20a4ccaec69c484ce0bcd03d2e8a83e489.csv)

The `farm_id` in the `ranchers` table is an example of a `foreign key`. Each entry in the `farm_id` (foreign key) column corresponds to an `id` (primary key) in the `farms` table. This allows us to track which farm each rancher belongs to while keeping the tables normalized.

If we could only see the `ranchers` table, we would know that John, Jane, and Jen all work together and that Jim and Jay also work together. However, to know where any of them work, we would need to look at the `farms` table.

## **Challenge**

How many records in the products table belong to the category "confections"?

# Objective 2 - query data from multiple tables

Now that we understand the basics of querying data from a single table, let's move on to selecting data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.

## **Overview**

We can use a `JOIN` to combine query data from multiple tables using a single `SELECT` statement.

There are different types of joins; some are listed below:

- inner joins.
- outer joins.
- left joins.
- right joins.
- cross joins.
- non-equality joins.
- self joins.

Using `joins` requires that the two tables of interest contain at least one field with shared information. For example, if a *departments* table has an *id* field, and an employee table has a *department_id* field, and the values that exist in the *id* column of the *departments* table live in the *department_id* field of the employee table, we can use those fields to join both tables like so:

```sql
select * from employees
join departments on employees.department_id = departments.id
```

This query will return the data from both tables for every instance where the `ON` condition is true. If there are employees with no value for department*id or where the value stored in the field does not correspond to an existing id in the* departments *table, then that record will NOT be returned. In a similar fashion, any records from the* departments *table that don't have an employee associated with them will also be omitted from the results. Basically, if the* id\* does not show as the value of department_id for an employee, it won't be able to join.

We can shorten the condition by giving the table names an alias. This is a common practice. Below is the same example using aliases, picking which fields to return and sorting the results:

```sql
select d.id, d.name, e.id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary
from employees as e
join departments as d
  on e.department_id = d.id
order by d.name, e.last_name
```

Notice that we can take advantage of white space and indentation to make queries more readable.

There are several ways of writing joins, but the one shown here should work on all database management systems and avoid some pitfalls, so we recommend it.

The syntax for performing a similar join using Knex is as follows:

```
db('employees as e')
  .join('departments as d', 'e.department_id', 'd.id')
  .select('d.id', 'd.name', 'e.first_name', 'e.last_name', 'e.salary')
```

## **Follow Along**

A good explanation of how the different types of joins can be seen [in this article from w3resource.com (Links to an external site.)](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/sql-joins.php).

## **Challenge**

Use [this online tool (Links to an external site.)](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top) to write the following queries:

- list the products, including their category name.
- list the products, including the supplier name.
- list the products, including both the category name and supplier name.

# What is SQL Joins?

An SQL JOIN clause combines rows from two or more tables. It creates a set of rows in a temporary table.

# How to Join two tables in SQL?

A JOIN works on two or more tables if they have at least one common field and have a relationship between them.

JOIN keeps the base tables (structure and data) unchanged.

# Join vs. Subquery

- JOINs are faster than a subquery and it is very rare that the opposite.
- In JOINs the RDBMS calculates an execution plan, that can predict, what data should be loaded and how much it will take to processed and as a result this process save some times, unlike the subquery there is no pre-process calculation and run all the queries and load all their data to do the processing.
- A JOIN is checked conditions first and then put it into table and displays; where as a subquery take separate temp table internally and checking condition.
- When joins are using, there should be connection between two or more than two tables and each table has a relation with other while subquery means query inside another query, has no need to relation, it works on columns and conditions.

# SQL JOINS: EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN

The are two types of SQL JOINS - EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN

1. SQL EQUI JOIN :

The SQL EQUI JOIN is a simple SQL join uses the equal sign(=) as the comparison operator for the condition. It has two types - SQL Outer join and SQL Inner join.

2. SQL NON EQUI JOIN :

The **SQL NON EQUI JOIN** is a join uses comparison operator other than the equal sign like >, <, >=, <= with the condition.

**SQL EQUI JOIN : INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN**

The SQL EQUI JOIN can be classified into two types - INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN

1. SQL INNER JOIN

This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from tables where the key record of one table is equal to the key records of another table.

2. SQL OUTER JOIN

This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from one table and only those rows from the secondary table where the joined condition is satisfying i.e. the columns are equal in both tables.

In order to perform a JOIN query, the required information we need are:

**a)** The name of the tables**b)** Name of the columns of two or more tables, based on which a condition will perform.

**Syntax:**

```
FROM table1
join_type table2
[ON (join_condition)]

```

**Parameters:**

**Pictorial Presentation of SQL Joins:**

![https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/sql-joins-all.gif](https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/sql-joins-all.gif)

**Example:**

**Sample table: company**

**Sample table: foods**

To join two tables 'company' and 'foods', the following SQL statement can be used :

**SQL Code:**

```
SELECT  company.company_id,company.company_name,
foods.item_id,foods.item_name
FROM company,foods;
```

Copy

Output:

```

# Objective 3 - write database access methods

## **Overview**

While we can write database code directly into our endpoints, best practices dictate that all database logic exists in separate, modular methods. These files containing database access helpers are often called **models**

## **Follow Along**

To handle CRUD operations for a single resource, we would want to create a **model** (or database access file) containing the following methods:

```
function find() {
}

function findById(id) {
}

function add(user) {
}

function update(changes, id) {
}

function remove(id) {
}
```

Each of these functions would use Knex logic to perform the necessary database operation.

```
function find() {
  return db('users');
}
```

For each method, we can choose what value to return. For example, we may prefer `findById()` to return a single `user` object rather than an array.

```
function findById(id) {
// first() returns the first entry in the db matching the query
  return db('users').where({ id }).first();
}
```

We can also use existing methods like `findById()` to help `add()` return the new user (instead of just the id).

```
function add(user) {
  db('users').insert(user)
    .then(ids => {
      return findById(ids[0]);
    });
}
```

Once all methods are written as desired, we can export them like so:

```
module.exports = {
  find,
  findById,
  add,
  update,
  delete,
}
```

…and use the helpers in our endpoints

```jsx
const User = require('./user-model.js');

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  User.find()
    .then(users => {
      res.json(users);
    })
    .catch(&nbsp;err => {});
});
```

There should no be `knex` code in the endpoints themselves.
