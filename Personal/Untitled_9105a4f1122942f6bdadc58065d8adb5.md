# **What to expect when you take the General Coding Assessment (GCA)**

The General Coding Assessment consists of **4 tasks** of varying difficulty that assess different coding skills, primarily focusing on implementation and problem solving ability. You will have **70 minutes** to complete the test, and you may split your time as you wish during the assessment.

All tasks will be accessible from when the timer begins until the end of the 70 minute period. Each task asks you to solve a problem by coding in the test itself (outside IDEs are not permitted). Your responses will be scored based on **correctness**, **speed**, **style**, **implementation**, and your **problem solving ability**. Once you complete the assessment, your score will be reviewed and certified if no unusual activity took place during your session. This score is part of a larger result, your Coding Report, which displays your other test scores and assesses your overall coding speed, problem solving ability, and implementation skills.

# **Structure of the GCA**

When you begin the test, you will see a page with **instructions for setting up your computer and workspace** to take the test. You'll see the screen shown below when you first click the link:

Once you've completed these set-up steps, you will see the screen shown below. Here you will see the name of the test and variations on the duration and tasks in an actual live test.

To begin the test, **choose the language** (you can change it any time during the test from the IDE) and **accept the rules**.

When you click **NEXT**, the timer begins and you will see all of the tasks. You can complete the tasks in any order.

When you click on **VIEW TASK**, you will see the task description on the left side of your screen and the **IDE** for coding your solution on the right:
