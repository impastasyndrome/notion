I’ve made it a goal to learn at least one useful thing each day so that I can stay sharp and well-versed on the topic of [web development](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/4-website-development-best-practices-to-ensure-happy-site-visitors/) and design. To that end, here’s some of the websites I keep track of to find new techniques, resources, and news about building websites.

**Most** of these sites are **updated frequently**, so there’s never a lack of new content that fills up my Google Reader.

Because the role of the web developer is **ever-expanding**, I’ve also included a variety of sites that covers fields relating to web development – such information architecture, user interaction, and web/graphics design.

### 1. [NETTUTS](http://nettuts.com/)

_NETTUTS_ is a recently launched blog/tutorial site that provides “_spoonfed web skills_“. There are already plenty of useful and detailed tutorials that range from [offloading static content to Amazon S3](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/use-amazon-s3-firefox-to-serve-static-files--net-20) to creating a beautiful [tabbed content area using jQuery](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-slick-tabbed-content-area-using-css-jquery--net-13). NETTUTS is perfect for developers just starting out, since the tutorials are very thorough and in a “step by step” format. For more advanced developers, it’s an excellent source of inspiration and learning new techniques.
