# Metrics

Description: Pick up the work started by previous teams on Metrics that measure data of interest.

We're building a "monitoring and evaluation" tool, so Metrics will be our users' main window into their data to do this!

Default metrics should be automatically generated based on each service added to the platform.

Additional metrics can also be added manuallyâ€”e.g. "composite" metrics, such as:

- ratio of money spent / [set of services]
- density of [set of services] / [given area]
- frequency of [set of services]

Make metrics as generalized and composable as possible to empower users to build them based on their own use cases.

Work closely with the stakeholder and all the Labs managers.
